# Migrate a TF/DCL Beta Resource to Direct (AI-Assisted Workflow)

This workflow requires case-by-case discussion due to the complexity of the Terraform and DCL-based reconcilers' non Kubernetes-native issues, and the requirements to keep API backward compatibility.

Migrating resources from Terraform or DCL to the direct controller model while maintaining backward compatibility is a complex challenge. We are actively developing more sophisticated AI-assisted tooling to better handle these scenarios. New capabilities are on the horizon, so please stay tuned. In the meantime, we recommend filing a GitHub issue to discuss your specific migration case with the KCC team.
