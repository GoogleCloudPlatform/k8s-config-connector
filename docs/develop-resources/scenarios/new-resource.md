# Add a new ConfigConnector resource

*Understand the current status*

* If the resource is not in [ConfigConnector API Reference](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/overview), it could be an Alpha resource. Check if [the CRD](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/tree/master/crds) exists with the latest release. If so, please go to [promote alpha to beta](./alpha-to-beta.md)   

* We are migrating from the TF/DCL based resources to the Direct approach. That means we are holding off new PR reviews if they are using the TF/DCL based approach. Please let us know if you encounter any problems or any specific reasons that can only use the TF/DCL based approach.

* If you want to contribute on a pure Direct resource, please verify it is not in Alpha first and then file an issue to let us know.  

## A basic infra 

Different than other scenarios, developing a pure Direct resource requires you to have every step setup first to validate your change. Basically you need the API and mapper to write the Direct controller, then youÂ can use the controller to write the MockGCP tests. This reverses the step 1 to the end compared to other scenarios. Thus, you first PR shall include

1. A basic API from the auto-generated code, including all required fields (Step 2)
2. A basic Direct controller (Step 3 and 4).
3. Define `create.yaml` and `update.yaml` to run against the real GCP (Step 1 [record real gcp](https://github.com/yuwenma/k8s-config-connector/blob/scifi-guide/docs/develop-resources/guides/1-add-mockgcp-tests.md#record-real-gcp-log)) (TODO update link)

### PR reviews

* Code shall come from the auto-generate code.
* Only the basic test suite is required, full and other test suites can comment out unimplemented fields.
* `_http.log` and  `_generated_object_<resource>.golden.yaml` shall verify the basic controller is functioning.

## Add MockGCP 

Add the mockGCP (Step 1) 

### PR reviews

* The `_http.log` shall have minimum changes.
* The  `_generated_object_<resource>.golden.yaml`, `create.yaml` and `update.yaml` shall not change

## Add full api and mapping

* Add all API fields.
* Add full test suites.

### PR reviews 

* No `/*NOTYET .. */` in the api and mapping.
* We require the MockGCP test suits to cover all fields. 
* We require the roundtrip fuzz tests to cover all the fields in `spec` and `status.observedState` fields [example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/blob/0bbac86ace6ab2f4051b574f026d5fe47fa05b75/pkg/controller/direct/redis/cluster/roundtrip_test.go#L92)
* The version has to start from v1alpha1.
