# Guide for Developing Config Connector Direct Resources 

We are thrilled to introduce the guide for adding Config Connector resources and fields! Resources built using this guide are called "Config Connector Direct Controllers", because they are built directly against the service API. Developing a new resource (or a new field) is much faster and more manageable using this new Direct Controller approach than previous approaches. We have changed some key resource reconciliation processes to be more reliable and Kubernetes-native. We have also made a revolutionary change to the test driven development and PR review process to improve test coverageÂ for every field in a resource. 

While there is more work to be done to further improve the process of adding Config Connector resources, we believe the guide is now ready to be shared broadly, such that Google developers, partners, and customers can add Config Connector resources. We will continue improving this guide to make it simpler and easier to develop new Config Connector resources. Please stay tuned for the upcoming changes.

## Develop by scenarios

To determine the best approach for adding support for the resource or field, please check the resource's current status:
**Check the CRD:** Examine the latest [CRDs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/tree/master/crds). The version can be found from the file name. If the resource exists but is in Alpha (and therefore not yet in the [Config Connector API Reference](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/overview)), follow the [Alpha to Beta promotion guide](./scenarios/alpha-to-beta.md).  This may be the simplest solution.
**File an issue (if no CRD exists):** If no CRD is found, you'll likely need to create a new resource. Before starting this process, check if an issue is already filed. If not, please file an issue to avoid duplication of effort and allow us to coordinate effectively. If you are willing to take the resource yourself, please assign the issue. 
**Prioritize the Direct approach:** We are currently prioritizing the Direct approach over TF/DCL-based resource implementations.  If you encounter issues preventing the use of the Direct approach, please let us know in the filed issue so we can assist.
