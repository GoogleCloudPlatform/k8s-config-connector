# Contributing

While we appreciate your interest in the Declarative Client Library, due to the
nature of the DCL we aren't able to accept community contributions.

If you'd like to contribute to Google Cloud's declarative configuration efforts,
take a look at
[Terraform Provider Google](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google),
which makes use of the DCL.
