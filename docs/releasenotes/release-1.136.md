## New Beta Resources (Direct Reconciler):

*   [`AssetFeed`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/asset/assetfeed)
*   [`BigQueryReservationAssignment`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/bigqueryreservation/bigqueryreservationassignment)
*   [`CloudDeployDeliveryPipeline`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/clouddeploy/clouddeploydeliverypipeline)
*   [`ComposerEnvironment`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/composer/composerenvironment)

## New Fields:

*   [`ComposerEnvironment`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/composer/composerenvironment)
    *   Added `spec.storageConfig` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.workloadsConfig.dagProcessor` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.workloadsConfig.triggerer` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.softwareConfig.webServerPluginsMode` field.
    *   Added `spec.config.softwareConfig.cloudDataLineageIntegration` field.

## Reconciliation Improvements:

*   Introduce [Stateful Reconciliation for Direct Controllers](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/blob/master/docs/designs/stateful-reconciliation-with-cookie.md). The controller will store a hash of the last successfully applied `.spec` in the resource's `.status`. This provides a lightweight, GitOps-safe historical record, allowing the controller to know with certainty when a user has modified their desired state. This enhanced reconciliation will be applied to the KRM-native controller gradually

## Bug Fixes:

*   Added support for checking etag in spec for alpha resources.
*   Fixed an issue where `CloudIdentityMembership` roles comparison would fail.
*   Fixed a bug where the wrong GVK was reported in IAM controller.
*   Fixed a bug where errors were swallowed when reading a Secret.
*   Fixed an issue with LRO endTime in mockgcp.
*   Fixed a bug in the etag mapper.
*   Fixed a bug in the mapper generator for slice and single object map.
*   Fixed a bug in the mapper generator for OneOf if the input is not proto.Message.
*   Fixed an import for refs in the same package in controllerbuilder.
