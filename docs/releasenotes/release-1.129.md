## Announcement 

### SAMPLE_Simplified and More Reliable Resource Development 

* We launched a major improvement to the Config Connector resource development!  Our new approach significantly enhances reliability and provides a more native Kubernetes experience. Learn more in our [guide](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/tree/master/docs/develop-resources)   

## New Beta Resources (Direct Reconciler):

* [`SAMPLE_BigQueryConnectionConnection`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/bigqueryconnection/bigqueryconnectionconnection) (This is a sample, your actual release note should not contain `SAMPLE_`, otherwise it will be deleted)

     * Manage [connections](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/working-with-connections) to connect to Google services and external data sources

## New Alpha Resources (Direct Reconciler):

* `SAMPLE_KMSAutokeyConfig` (This is a sample, your actual release note should not contain `SAMPLE_`, otherwise it will be deleted)
 
    * Manage the [KMS auto key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/autokey-overview) which simplifies the CMEKs provisioning and assignment. 
 
## New Fields:

* [`SAMPLE_AlloyDBInstance`](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/alloydb/alloydbinstance) (This is a sample, your actual release note should not contain `SAMPLE_`, otherwise it will be deleted)

  * Added `spec.networkConfig.enableOutboundPublicIp` field.
  * Added `status.outboundPublicIpAddresses` field.

## Reconciliation Improvements

* [`SQLInstance`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/tree/master/pkg/test/resourcefixture/testdata/basic/sql/v1beta1/sqlinstance)

    * All SQLInstance types are now reconciled using the new direct controller (instead of the legacy Terraform-based controller). The previous "opt-in" annotation (documented [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/blob/master/docs/features/optin.md)) no longer applies. Users no longer need to apply the "opt-in" annotation to SQLInstance resources to enable the direct controller. Regardless of the presence (or absence) of an opt-in annotation on SQLInstance resources, the direct reconciler will be used.
    * This change enables all SQLInstance resources to switch from edition ENTERPRISE -> ENTERPRISE_PLUS and fixes [this bug](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/issues/2907).


## New features:

* SAMPLE_Add cluster mode ...  (This is a sample, your actual release note should not contain `SAMPLE_`, otherwise it will be deleted)

    *  User can configure the ControllerReconciler object (Alpha) to set the rate-limit for all their cnrm manager controllers in the cluster. This example shows how to set up the configuration.

## Bug Fixes:

* [SAMPLE_Issue 3007](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/pull/3007) ComputeBackendService cannot refer clientTLSPolicy due to invalid format (This is a sample, your actual release note should not contain `SAMPLE_`, otherwise it will be deleted)
