# GitHub Actions Workflow Generation

The main CI presubmit workflow file, `.github/workflows/ci-presubmit.yaml`, is automatically generated. This document explains how the generation works and how to add new service-specific test workflows.

## Overview

The generation process is handled by the `dev/tasks/generate-github-actions` script. This script scans the `dev/ci/presubmits/` directory for executable files. For each file it finds, it creates a corresponding job in the `.github/workflows/ci-presubmit.yaml` file.

Most services are tested as part of a general "unclassified" test suite, which is defined in `dev/ci/presubmits/tests-e2e-samples-unclassified`.

To improve test isolation and speed up CI, we are moving towards having dedicated, per-service test workflows. This involves creating a new script for the service in `dev/ci/presubmits/` and excluding it from the "unclassified" suite.

## Instructions for Adding a Per-Service Test Workflow

To create a new CI job that runs E2E tests for a specific service, follow these steps. The instructions use `storage` service as an example.

### 1. Create a new presubmit script for the service

Create a new file named `dev/ci/presubmits/tests-e2e-samples-<service_name>`. For the `storage` service, the file would be `dev/ci/presubmits/tests-e2e-samples-storage`.

This script should run the E2E tests for only the target service. You can use the `RUN_TEST_APIGROUP` environment variable for this. The value should be the service's API group, e.g., `storage.cnrm.cloud.google.com`.

Here is a template for the script. Remember to make it executable (`chmod +x <file_path>`).

**Example for `dev/ci/presubmits/tests-e2e-samples-storage`:**
```bash

REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

cd ${REPO_ROOT}/

echo "Downloading envtest assets..."
export KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=$(go run sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/tools/setup-envtest@latest use -p path)

echo "Running fixtures in tests/e2e for storage..."

# The env var 'KCC_ENG_GROUP_EMAIL' needs to be set to unblock sample
# 'folder-level-entitlement'.
MOCK_GROUP_EMAIL="test@group.com"

RUN_E2E=1 \
E2E_KUBE_TARGET=envtest \
E2E_GCP_TARGET=mock \
KCC_USE_DIRECT_RECONCILERS="ComputeForwardingRule,SpannerInstance" \
KCC_ENG_GROUP_EMAIL="${MOCK_GROUP_EMAIL}" \
RUN_TEST_APIGROUP="storage.cnrm.cloud.google.com" \
  go test -test.count=1 -timeout 1h30m -v ./tests/e2e -run TestAllInSeries/samples
```

### 2. Exclude the service from the unclassified test suite

Modify the `dev/ci/presubmits/tests-e2e-samples-unclassified` script to add the service's API group to the `SKIP_TEST_APIGROUP` environment variable. This prevents the tests from running twice.

For the `storage` service, you would add `storage.cnrm.cloud.google.com` to the comma-separated list in `SKIP_TEST_APIGROUP`.

### 3. Regenerate the GitHub Actions workflow file

Run the `dev/tasks/generate-github-actions` script to update the `.github/workflows/ci-presubmit.yaml` file.

```bash
./dev/tasks/generate-github-actions
```

This will create a new job in the workflow file named `tests-e2e-samples-<service_name>`.

### 4. Verify and commit the changes

Review the changes to ensure the new job is present in `.github/workflows/ci-presubmit.yaml` and the service is excluded from the unclassified tests. Then commit the new script, the updated `tests-e2e-samples-unclassified` script, and the regenerated `ci-presubmit.yaml`.
