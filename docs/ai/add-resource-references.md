This document provides instructions on how to handle API resource references in KCC.

## Background

In KCC, a resource can reference another resource. For example, a `StorageBucket` might have a `kmsKeyName` field that references a `KMSKey` resource. When KCC sees such a reference, it needs to resolve the reference to the fully-qualified GCP resource name.

The way KCC handles this is by defining a "reference" object. This object is a struct that implements the `refsv1beta1.Ref` interface. This interface has methods that allow the generic normalization logic to resolve the reference.

The reference object is typically placed in its own file, `apis/<service>/<version>/*_reference.go`. For example, the reference object for `BigQueryBigLakeTable` is in `apis/bigquerybiglake/v1alpha1/table_reference.go`.

## Task

Your task is to identify fields in KCC's API that are references to other GCP resources, and change them to use the KCC reference object.

### Identifying Reference Fields

There are two cases to consider:

1.  **Greenfield resources:** These are resources that are being added to KCC for the first time. In this case, you should look at the comments for each field in the API. If a field's comment indicates that it is a reference to another GCP resource, then you should mark it as a reference by adding the `//+kcc:ref={Your guess of its KCC kind}` annotation.

2.  **Terraform/DCL-migrated resources:** These are resources that are being migrated from Terraform or DCL to KCC. In this case, you should look at the `config/crds` differences. The field may be different by ending with `*Ref`, and is a structure with fields like "name", "namespace", and/or "external", rather than a string.

### Changing a Field to a Reference

Once you have identified a reference field, you need to change its type to be a pointer to the reference object. For example, if you have a field `KmsKeyName *string`, and you have determined that it is a reference to a `KMSKey` resource, you should change it to `KmsKeyRef *KMSKeyRef`.

If the reference object does not exist, you should create one. You can use `apis/bigquerybiglake/v1alpha1/table_reference.go` as a template.

Here is an example of a reference object:
