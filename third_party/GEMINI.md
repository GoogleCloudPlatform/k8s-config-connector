# Directory: third_party

This directory contains third-party dependencies that are vendored into the Config Connector repository.

The code in this directory is not written by the KCC team but is used by the project. Dependencies are managed using Go modules, so this directory may not be as heavily used as it once was.

When you need to inspect the code of a third-party library that KCC depends on, you might find it here.

See also the `go.mod` file in the root of the project for the primary list of dependencies.
