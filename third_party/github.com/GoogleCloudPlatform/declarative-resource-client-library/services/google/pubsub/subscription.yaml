          description: The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub
            waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message.
            In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged,
            it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message
            will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions,
            this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override
            this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding
            `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest`
            if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is
            10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds
            (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is
            used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
            for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges
            the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.

                Endpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
