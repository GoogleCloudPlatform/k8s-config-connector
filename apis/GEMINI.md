# Directory: apis

This directory contains the Go type definitions for all the Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that Config Connector manages.

## Structure

Each subdirectory corresponds to a GCP service (e.g., `storage`, `compute`, `iam`). Within each service directory, there are versioned subdirectories (e.g., `v1beta1`) that contain the `*_types.go` files defining the Go structs for the CRDs.

These structs are used by the Kubernetes API server and the controllers to understand the structure of the KCC resources.

The `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` files are automatically generated by `controller-gen` and should not be edited manually.

## Key Packages

*   `common/`: Contains shared types and interfaces used across multiple CRDs, such as `ResourceReference` for specifying relationships between resources.
*   `refs/`: Contains helper functions for resolving resource references.

When working with KCC resources, you will often need to import the types from this directory.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` for more context on the project.
