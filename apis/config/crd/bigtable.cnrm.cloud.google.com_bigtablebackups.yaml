                                     one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                     the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                     `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                     (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                     In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                     expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                     scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                     server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                     * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                       value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                       breaking changes.)

                                     Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                     protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                     type.googleapis.com.

                                     Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                     used with implementation specific semantics.
