                                       time series' current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a
                                       danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers
                                       below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above.
                                       Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers
                                       above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts
                                       it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)


                                       As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:


                                       ```
                                       {
                                         value: 90,
                                         category: 'DANGER',
                                         trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                       },
                                       {
                                         value: 70,
                                         category: 'WARNING',
                                         trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                       },
                                       {
                                         value: 10,
                                         category: 'DANGER',
                                         trigger: 'BELOW',
                                       },
                                       {
                                         value: 20,
                                         category: 'WARNING',
                                         trigger: 'BELOW',
                                       }
                                       ```


                                       Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER
                                       state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state,
                                       values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal
                                       to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to
                                       90 a DANGER state.

                                                  An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                   time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                   alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                   mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                   each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                   Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                   series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                   to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is
                                                   specified, then `per_series_aligner` must be specified, and must not be
                                                   `ALIGN_NONE`. An `alignment_period` must also be specified; otherwise, an
                                                   error is returned.

                                                  The set of fields to preserve when `cross_series_reducer` is
                                                   specified. The `group_by_fields` determine how the time series are
                                                   partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                   operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                   value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                                   series is a member of exactly one subset. The
                                                   `cross_series_reducer` is applied to each subset of time series.
                                                   It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
                                                   this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                                   specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated away.  If
                                                   `group_by_fields` is not specified and all the time series have
                                                   the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into
                                                   a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not

                                                  An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                   time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                   alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                   mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                   each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                   Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                   choices depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the original time
                                                   series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                                   the time series.


                                                   Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                                   series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is specified, then
                                                   `per_series_aligner` must be specified and not equal to `ALIGN_NONE`
                                                   and `alignment_period` must be specified; otherwise, an error is

                                                         time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                         alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                         mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                         each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                         Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                         choices depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the original time
                                                         series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                                         the time series.


                                                         Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                                         series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is specified, then
                                                         `per_series_aligner` must be specified and not equal to `ALIGN_NONE`
                                                         and `alignment_period` must be specified; otherwise, an error is
                                                         returned.

                                                        An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                         time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                         alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                         mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                         each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                         Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                         series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                   Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                   time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different

                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order

                                                   alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be

                                                  An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                   time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                   alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                   mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for

                                                      An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                       time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                       alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                       mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                       each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.

                                                  The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used
                                                   to divide the data in all the

                                                   The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than

                                                   The maximum value of the `alignment_period` is 2 years, or 104 weeks.

                                                   time series, where the value of each data point in the resulting series is
                                                   a function of all the already aligned values in the input time series.


                                                   Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                   choices depend on the `metric_kind` and the `value_type` of the original
                                                   time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different
                                                   `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.


                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                                                   to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is
                                                   specified, then `per_series_aligner` must be specified, and must not be

                                                   specified. The `group_by_fields` determine how the time series are
                                                   partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                   operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                   value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                                   series is a member of exactly one subset. The
                                                   `cross_series_reducer` is applied to each subset of time series.
                                                   It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
                                                   this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not

                                                   the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into
                                                   a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not

                                                   time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                   alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                   mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                   each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                   Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                   series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                                   the time series.


                                                   Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                                   series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is specified, then

                                The thresholds used to determine the state of the scorecard given the
                                 time series' current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a
                                 danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers
                                 below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above.
                                 Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers
                                 above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts
                                 it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)


                                 As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:


                                 ```
                                 {
                                   value: 90,
                                   category: 'DANGER',
                                   trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                 },
                                 {
                                   value: 70,
                                   category: 'WARNING',
                                   trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                 },
                                 {
                                   value: 10,
                                   category: 'DANGER',
                                   trigger: 'BELOW',
                                 },
                                 {
                                   value: 20,
                                   category: 'WARNING',
                                   trigger: 'BELOW',
                                 }
                                 ```


                                 Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER
                                 state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state,
                                 values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal
                                 to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to
                                 90 a DANGER state.

                                            The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used
                                             to divide the data in all the

                                             the data.


                                             The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than

                                             Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                                             time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different
                                             `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.


                                             Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order

                                             operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                             value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                             series is a member of exactly one subset. The

                                                An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                 time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                 alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                 mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                 each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                 Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                 series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                 The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than

                                            The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used
                                             to divide the data in all the
                                             [time series][google.monitoring.v3.TimeSeries] into consistent blocks of
                                             time. This will be done before the per-series aligner can be applied to
                                             the data.


                                             The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than
                                             `ALIGN_NONE` is specified, this field is required or an error is returned.

                                             a function of all the already aligned values in the input time series.


                                             Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid
                                             choices depend on the `metric_kind` and the `value_type` of the original
                                             time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different
                                             `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.


                                             Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                                             to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is
                                             specified, then `per_series_aligner` must be specified, and must not be
                                             `ALIGN_NONE`. An `alignment_period` must also be specified; otherwise, an
                                             error is returned.

                                             partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                             operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                             value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                             series is a member of exactly one subset. The
                                             `cross_series_reducer` is applied to each subset of time series.
                                             It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
                                             this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                             specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated away.  If

                                             the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into
                                             a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not

                                            An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                             time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                             alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                             mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                             each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                             Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
                                             choices depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the original time
                                             series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                             the time series.


                                             Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time

                                                  The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used

                                                   The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than
                                                   `ALIGN_NONE` is specified, this field is required or an error is returned.

                                                   The maximum value of the `alignment_period` is 2 years, or 104 weeks.

                                                   time series, where the value of each data point in the resulting series is

                                                   Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                   choices depend on the `metric_kind` and the `value_type` of the original
                                                   time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different

                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                                                   to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is
                                                   specified, then `per_series_aligner` must be specified, and must not be

                                                   specified. The `group_by_fields` determine how the time series are

                                                   operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                   value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                                   series is a member of exactly one subset. The

                                                   It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order

                                                   Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order

                                                   It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                                                   Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                   time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different

                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order

                                                   operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                   value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                                   series is a member of exactly one subset. The

                                                   It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                                                   Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                   Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order

                                                   operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                   value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time

                                                   It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                                                          An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                           time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                           alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                           mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                           each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                           Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                           series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                     danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers
                                     below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above.
                                     Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers
                                     above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts
                                     it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)


                                     As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:


                                     ```
                                     {
                                       value: 90,
                                       category: 'DANGER',
                                       trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                     },
                                     {
                                       value: 70,
                                       category: 'WARNING',
                                       trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                     },
                                     {
                                       value: 10,
                                       category: 'DANGER',
                                       trigger: 'BELOW',
                                     },
                                     {
                                       value: 20,
                                       category: 'WARNING',
                                       trigger: 'BELOW',
                                     }
                                     ```


                                     Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER
                                     state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state,
                                     values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal
                                     to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to
                                     90 a DANGER state.

                                                An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                 time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                 alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                 mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                 each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                 Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid

                                                 series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                    The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used

                                                 specified. The `group_by_fields` determine how the time series are
                                                 partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                 operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                 value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                                 series is a member of exactly one subset. The
                                                 `cross_series_reducer` is applied to each subset of time series.
                                                 It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
                                                 this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                                 specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated away.  If
                                                 `group_by_fields` is not specified and all the time series have
                                                 the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into
                                                 a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not
                                                 defined, this field is ignored.

                                              description: |-
                                                An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                 time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                 alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                 mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                 each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                 Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                 choices depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the original time
                                                 series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                                 the time series.


                                                 Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                                 series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is specified, then
                                                 `per_series_aligner` must be specified and not equal to `ALIGN_NONE`
                                                 and `alignment_period` must be specified; otherwise, an error is
                                                 returned.

                                                       mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for

                                                       series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                       It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
                                                       this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not

                                                       the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into
                                                       a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not

                                                      An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                       time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                       alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                       mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                       each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                       Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                       choices depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the original time
                                                       series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                                       the time series.


                                                       Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                                       series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is specified, then
                                                       `per_series_aligner` must be specified and not equal to `ALIGN_NONE`
                                                       and `alignment_period` must be specified; otherwise, an error is

                                                         mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for

                                       time series' current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a
                                       danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers
                                       below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above.
                                       Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers
                                       above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts
                                       it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)


                                       As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:


                                       ```
                                       {
                                         value: 90,
                                         category: 'DANGER',
                                         trigger: 'ABOVE',

                                       {
                                         value: 70,
                                         category: 'WARNING',
                                         trigger: 'ABOVE',
                                       },
                                       {
                                         value: 10,
                                         category: 'DANGER',
                                         trigger: 'BELOW',
                                       },
                                       {
                                         value: 20,
                                         category: 'WARNING',
                                         trigger: 'BELOW',
                                       }
                                       ```


                                       Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER
                                       state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state,
                                       values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal
                                       to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to
                                       90 a DANGER state.

                                                   The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than

                                                       alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                       mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for

                                                  An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                   time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                   alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                   mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                   each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.


                                                   Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                   choices depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the original time
                                                   series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of
                                                   the time series.


                                                   Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                                   series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is specified, then
                                                   `per_series_aligner` must be specified and not equal to `ALIGN_NONE`
                                                   and `alignment_period` must be specified; otherwise, an error is
                                                   returned.

                                                             time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                             alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                             mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                             each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.

                                                             series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                        An `Aligner` describes how to bring the data points in a single
                                                         time series into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all
                                                         alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                         mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                                                         each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.

                                                         series. Alignment can change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type` of

                                                        The reduction operation to be used to combine time series into a single
                                                         time series, where the value of each data point in the resulting series is
                                                         a function of all the already aligned values in the input time series.


                                                         Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid
                                                         choices depend on the `metric_kind` and the `value_type` of the original
                                                         time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different
                                                         `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.


                                                         Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                                                         to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is
                                                         specified, then `per_series_aligner` must be specified, and must not be

                                                         operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                                                         value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                                                         series is a member of exactly one subset. The

                                                         It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                                                         a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not

                                                         alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                                                         mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
