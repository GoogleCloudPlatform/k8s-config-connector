# Directory: pkg/krm

This directory contains utilities for working with the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM).

It provides helper functions for manipulating Kubernetes objects, such as adding annotations, checking conditions, and working with resource references.

These utilities are used throughout the KCC codebase to simplify the process of working with Kubernetes resources.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and `pkg/GEMINI.md`.
