	// This is based on workqueue.DefaultControllerRateLimiter, but with different parameters better suited to KRM reconciliation.
	// Context is in b/188203307

	// We have both overall and per-item rate limiting.
	// The overall is a token bucket and the per-item is exponential
	// The per-item rate limiter initially retries much more slowly (2 seconds vs 2 milliseconds),
	// and a much faster ultimate limit (120 seconds instead of 1000 seconds).

	// If we implement b/190097904 we should revisit these values, in particular the max delay could
	// likely be much higher again.

	return workqueue.NewMaxOfRateLimiter(

// RequeueRateLimiter slows down the periodic object re-reconcile, so that we can remain responsive to new changes.
//
// KCC schedules its objects for periodic-requeuing by returning from a
// successful Reconcile invocation with the RequeueAfter value set,
// by default to 10 minutes (with some skew to avoid a thundering-herd).
//
// The problem there is that once you have "too many objects", every object gets
// requeued, and RequeueAfter time passes before we can clear the backlog.
// So we end up with every object queued up for re-reconciliation.
//
// The big problem with that is that then _new_ changes - in particular
// user-initiated changes - are added to the back of the queue.  Then these
// user-initiated changes experience a long delay while every other object
// gets reconciled, before they get their turn.  We want to remain responsive
// to user-changes, even when there are lots of objects being re-reconciled.
//
// The workaround is to introduce an additional delay on RequeueAfter,
// to avoid the backlog building up.  We do this using a dedicated
// rate limiter, that (currently) is configured to keep the requeue
// traffic to 5 qps.  That will hopefully leave enough capacity for
// more latency sensitive reconciliations, at the expense of a longer
// delay in re-reconciliation.

// SetMasterRateLimiter sets the the kubernetes client level rate limiter.
// This rate limiter is shared among all requests created by the client.
// If specified, it will override the QPS and Burst fields.
//
// By default, this rate limiter uses tokenBucketRateLimiter(20.0, 30).
// In ConfigConnector, this becomes a bottleneck when re-reconciliate a large amount of ConfigConnector resources.
//
// One potential downside of bumping this rate limit is that ConfigConnector could hit GCP service quotes due to the
// more aggressive GCP requests. For your information, the IAM quota has Read request 6,000 per minute, and Write requests 600 per minute. https://cloud.google.com/iam/quotas
