  description: |-
    This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
    before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
    delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
    acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
    again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

    For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
    the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
    subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
    pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
    maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
    If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

    For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
    for the call to the push endpoint.

    If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
    will eventually redeliver the message.

    description: |-
      Endpoint configuration attributes.

      Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
      be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

      The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
      can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
      attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
      the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
      (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
      based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

      If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
      it will default to the version of the API used to make
      such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
      call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
      calls will always return a valid version, even if the
      subscription was created without this attribute.

      The possible values for this attribute are:

      - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
      - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
