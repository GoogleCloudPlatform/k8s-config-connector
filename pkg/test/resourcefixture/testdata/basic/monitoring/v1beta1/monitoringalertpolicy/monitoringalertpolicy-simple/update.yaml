      “Just the place for a Snark!” the Bellman cried,
      As he monitored his resources with care;
      Supporting each metric on the top of the tide
      By a finger entwined in his hair.

      “Just the place for a Snark! I have measured it twice:
      That alone should discourage the crew.
      Just the place for a Snark! I have measured it thrice:
      What I measure three times is true.”
