  annotations:
    # Tests for Firestore resources require Firestore to be enabled for the GCP
    # project, but there is currently no way to enable Firestore for a project
    # programmatically. So, for now, we use a preexisting project which already has
    # Firestore enabled for any test that tests Firestore resources.

  name: firestoreindex-${uniqueId}
spec:
  # We append a unique id to the collection name so that the Firestore Indexes
  # created for each test (i.e. the create/nochange/delete tests) are created
  # for different collections.
  #
  # This is a workaround meant to make our tests work. The issue is that when a
  # Firestore Index is deleted from GCP, it takes time for it to be fully
  # deleted. During that time, attempts to re-create the same index (an index
  # with the same fields and for the same collection) fails. There is
  # unfortunately no way to tell if a Firestore Index has been fully deleted.
