apiVersion: firestore.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: FirestoreIndex
metadata:
  name: firestoreindex-${uniqueId}
spec:
  # We append a unique id to the collection name so that the Firestore Indexes
  # created for each test (i.e. the create/nochange/delete tests) are created
  # for different collections.
  #
  # This is a workaround meant to make our tests work. The issue is that when a
  # Firestore Index is deleted from GCP, it takes time for it to be fully
  # deleted. During that time, attempts to re-create the same index (an index
  # with the same fields and for the same collection) fails. There is
  # unfortunately no way to tell if a Firestore Index has been fully deleted.
  collection: sample-collection-${uniqueId}
  fields:
  - fieldPath: field1
    order: ASCENDING
  - fieldPath: field2
