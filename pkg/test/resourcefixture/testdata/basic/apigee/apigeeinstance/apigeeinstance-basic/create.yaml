    # Note: This refers to a manually-created organization with default settings. This is 
    # because it is impossible to create multiple Apigee organizations in the same GCP project,
    # and it is also infeasible to create + delete organizations quickly enough for automated
    # testing. Deleting an organization takes 24 hours. For more information, see
    # https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations/delete#deletionretention).
