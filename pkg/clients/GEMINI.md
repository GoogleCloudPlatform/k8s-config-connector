# Directory: pkg/clients

This directory contains the clients for interacting with the Kubernetes API server and GCP APIs.

It provides a layer of abstraction over the raw client libraries, making it easier to work with Kubernetes and GCP resources in the controllers.

The clients in this package are used extensively throughout the KCC codebase.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and `pkg/GEMINI.md`.
