# Directory: pkg/gcp

This directory contains low-level clients and utilities for interacting with GCP services.

It provides a thin wrapper around the Google Cloud SDKs, making it easier to work with GCP APIs from the KCC controllers.

This package is used by the "direct" controllers in `pkg/controllers`.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and `pkg/GEMINI.md`.
