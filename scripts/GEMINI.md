# Directory: scripts

This directory contains various scripts used for CI/CD, release processes, and other automation.

While the `hack` directory contains scripts for local development, the scripts in this directory are typically used in automated environments.

## Examples

*   Release scripts for cutting a new version of KCC.
*   CI scripts for running tests and other checks.
*   Scripts for generating documentation or other artifacts.

When you need to understand the release process or how CI is configured, this is a good place to look.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and the `hack/GEMINI.md`.
