# Directory: version

This directory contains the version information for the Config Connector project.

The `version.go` file defines the version number for the current build of KCC. This version number is embedded into the binaries and container images at build time.

The version number is typically updated as part of the release process.

When you need to determine the version of KCC you are working with, this is the place to look.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and the `scripts/GEMINI.md` for information about the release process.
