The addon package contains tools opinionated for managing Kubernetes cluster addons.
The declarative.DeclarativeObject must be castable to a addonsv1alpha1.CommonObject
in order for this pattern to be used.

What is an Addon Object?

An Addon Object is an instance of a type defined as a CustomResourceDefinition that
implements the addonsv1alpha1.CommonObject interface. The object represents the intent
to deploy an instance of a specific Addon in the cluster. This pattern manages a
Kubernetes deployment for the specific addon based on the Addon Object.

# Writing an Addon Operator

Follow the dashboard walkthrough to stand up an addon operator[1]. Then dig into the
declarative and addon patterns to extend it.
