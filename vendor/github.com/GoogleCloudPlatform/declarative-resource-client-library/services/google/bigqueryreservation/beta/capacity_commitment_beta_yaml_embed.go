The name should\n                      be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types\n                      that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for\n                      URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one\n                      can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message\n                      definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https`\n                      is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type\n                      value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications\n                      are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have\n                      them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore,\n                      binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types.\n                      (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.)
