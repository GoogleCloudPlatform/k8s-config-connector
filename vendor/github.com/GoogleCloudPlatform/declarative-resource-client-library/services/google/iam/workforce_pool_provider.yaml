            expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication
            credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression
            must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The
            following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * `assertion`:
            JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider.
            * `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`.
            `google.profile_photo` and `google.display_name` are not supported. *
            `attribute`: The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`.
            The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters.
            If unspecified, all valid authentication credentials will be accepted.
            The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped
            `google.groups` value of `admins`: ``` "''admins'' in google.groups" ```'

            as `subject` and `segment`. Each key must be a string specifying the Google
            Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * `google.subject`:
            The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM
            bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs.
            This is a required field and the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes.
            * `google.groups`: Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can
            grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding;
            access applies to all members of the group. * `google.display_name`: The
            name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped
            display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, `google.subject` will
            be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings.
            * `google.profile_photo`: The URL that specifies the authenticated user''s
            thumbnail photo. This is an optional field. When set, the image will be
            visible as the user''s profile picture. If not set, a generic user icon
            will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM
            bindings. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`,
            where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped.
            You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of
            a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain
            the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies
            to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources.
