                Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in
                the dataset will have an 'expirationMs' property in the 'timePartitioning'
                settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
                affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
                have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
                Setting this property overrides the use of 'defaultTableExpirationMs'
                for partitioned tables: only one of 'defaultTableExpirationMs' and
                'defaultPartitionExpirationMs' will be used for any new partitioned
                table. If you provide an explicit 'timePartitioning.expirationMs' when

                Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset
                will have an 'expirationTime' property set to the creation time plus
                the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
                new tables, not existing ones. When the 'expirationTime' for a given
                table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                If a table's 'expirationTime' is modified or removed before the
                table expires, or if you provide an explicit 'expirationTime' when
                creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default

                There are two types of locations, regional or multi-regional. A regional
                location is a specific geographic place, such as Tokyo, and a multi-regional
                location is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
                contains at least two geographic places.


                Possible regional values include: 'asia-east1', 'asia-northeast1',
                'asia-southeast1', 'australia-southeast1', 'europe-north1',
                'europe-west2' and 'us-east4'.


                Possible multi-regional values: 'EU' and 'US'.


                The default value is multi-regional location 'US'.
                Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

                    The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.
                    The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data
                    has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.

                    To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts
                    the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the
                    data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator.
                    The default value is a comma (',').

                    If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records,
                    and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                    The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:
                    CSV: Trailing columns
                    JSON: Named values that don't match any column names

                    an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.

                    when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                    empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as
                    an empty value.

                    and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
                    The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                    If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.

                    Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or
                    supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND;
                    when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators.
                    For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:
                    ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
                    ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.

                    The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                    The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                    When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                    skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                    the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                    skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                    skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                    row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

                The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
                The possible values are -

                ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                              is selected in round robin order.

                LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                                hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

                RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                            hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                            addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                            1/N of the requests.

                RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

                ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
                                       connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                       to the same address as the destination address of
                                       the incoming connection before the connection
                                       was redirected to the load balancer.

                MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                         Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                         build times and host selection times. For more information about

                regional).

                When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
                rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
                rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding

                same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional
                forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule
                supports either IPv4 or IPv6.

                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
                1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the

                internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP
                range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

                                    streams.

                                    502, 503 or 504.

                                    connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                                    - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                    Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.

                                    REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.

                            1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                            you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                            future without any impact on existing rules.

                                    - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.

                                      REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.

                    Endpoint configuration attributes.

                    Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                    be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

                    The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                    can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                    attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                    the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                    (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
                    based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

                    If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                    it will default to the version of the API used to make
                    such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                    call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                    calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                    subscription was created without this attribute.

                    The possible values for this attribute are:

                    - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
                    - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.

                      in ComputeAddress CRD is used to specify whether it is a global
