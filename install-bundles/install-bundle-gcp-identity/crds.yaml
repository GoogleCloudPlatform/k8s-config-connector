                  Immutable. Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                  bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                  and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                  ONE regular Service Perimeter.

                  In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                  be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                  resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                  resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                  Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                  entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

                  Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                  topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                  with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                  themselves. Default value: "PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR" Possible values: ["PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR", "PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE"].

                  Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in
                  the dataset will have an 'expirationMs' property in the 'timePartitioning'
                  settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
                  affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
                  have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
                  Setting this property overrides the use of 'defaultTableExpirationMs'

                  'defaultPartitionExpirationMs' will be used for any new partitioned
                  table. If you provide an explicit 'timePartitioning.expirationMs' when

                  Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset
                  will have an 'expirationTime' property set to the creation time plus
                  the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
                  new tables, not existing ones. When the 'expirationTime' for a given
                  table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                  If a table's 'expirationTime' is modified or removed before the
                  table expires, or if you provide an explicit 'expirationTime' when
                  creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default

                      To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts
                      the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the
                      data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator.

                      The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:

                      when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                      empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as

                      when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators.
                      For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:
                      ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
                      ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.

                      The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                      When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                      skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                      the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                      skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                      skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                      row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

                         example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`.
                      3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for
                         a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'.
                      These parts are lower case.

                          Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example,

                          Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For
                          example:

                          1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
                             only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
                             same project as the `Function`.
                          2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
                             `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
                             `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
                             that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

                          Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
                          `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long"
                          format.

                          See each *service's* documentation for supported formats.

                            segment of the URL''s path must represent the fully qualified
                            name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`).
                            The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                            "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                            into the binary all types that they expect it to use in
                            the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme
                            `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                            up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions
                            as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type
                            value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications
                            are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                            or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                            Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently
                            available in the official protobuf release, and it is
                            not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com.

                        each instance group must live in the same zone as the instance
                        group itself. No two backends in a backend service are allowed to
                        use same Instance Group resource.

                        For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                        endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                        located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.

                        Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and Network Endpoint
                        Group backends.

                        When the 'load_balancing_scheme' is INTERNAL, only instance groups
                        are supported.

                      for UDP.

                      If set to 'NEVER_PERSIST', after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing
                      connections on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy

                description: |-
                  The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
                  The possible values are:

                  * 'ROUND_ROBIN': This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                                   is selected in round robin order.

                  * 'LEAST_REQUEST': An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                                     hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

                  * 'RING_HASH': The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                                 hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                                 addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                                 1/N of the requests.

                  * 'RANDOM': The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

                  * 'ORIGINAL_DESTINATION': Backend host is selected based on the client
                                            connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                            to the same address as the destination address of
                                            the incoming connection before the connection
                                            was redirected to the load balancer.

                  * 'MAGLEV': used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                              Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                              build times and host selection times. For more information about
                              Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824


                  This field is applicable to either:

                  * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

                  session affinity settings will not take effect.

                  Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
                  by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless

                  rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
                  rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
                  rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the
                  same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional
                  forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule
                  supports either IPv4 or IPv6.

                  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
                  1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
                  forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
                  internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP
                  range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

                    The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
                    VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
                    configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
                    address will be allocated from the IP address range specified
                    here.

                    For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
                    interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN
                    gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified
                    for this interconnect attachment.

                    If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
                    encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on
                    this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will
                    be allocated from regional external IP address pool.

                          * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.

                            for example due to connection timeouts.
                          * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.

                                * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with any 5xx response code,
                                  or if the backend service does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout,
                                * connection failure, and refused streams.
                                * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
                                * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services,
                                  for example due to connection timeouts.
                                * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                                * refused-stream:Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code.
                                  This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.

                                * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded

                                      - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                                      any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                                      example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                                      streams.
                                      - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                                      502, 503 or 504.
                                      - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                                      connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                                      - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                      Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                                      - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                                      REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                                      - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                      header is set to cancelled
                                      - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                                      gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                                      - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                      header is set to resource-exhausted
                                      - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if
                                      the gRPC status code in the response header is set to unavailable.

                              For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                              in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                              that matches the request is applied.

                              You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                              Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and

                              Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                              in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                              you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                              future without any impact on existing rules.

                  expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication
                  credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression
                  must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation.
                  The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * `assertion`:
                  JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider.
                  * `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the
                  `attribute_mappings`. * `attribute`: The custom attributes mapped
                  from the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`. The maximum length
                  of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified,
                  all valid authentication credential are accepted. The following
                  example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped `google.groups`
                  value of `admins`: ``` "''admins'' in google.groups" ```'

                  by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such
                  as `subject` and `segment`. Each key must be a string specifying
                  the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are
                  supported: * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating.
                  You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject
                  that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 characters.
                  * `google.groups`: Groups the external identity belongs to. You
                  can grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet`
                  binding; access applies to all members of the group. You can also
                  provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`,
                  where `{custom_attribute}` is the name of the custom attribute to
                  be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The
                  maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and
                  the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference
                  these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for
                  a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: * `google.subject`:
                  `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value}`
                  * `google.groups`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/group/{value}`
                  * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}`
                  Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel)
                  function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized
                  attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the
                  `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation
                  of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum
                  length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When
                  evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed
                  8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the
                  following default mapping applies: ``` { "google.subject":"assertion.arn",
                  "attribute.aws_role": "assertion.arn.contains(''assumed-role'')"
                  " ? assertion.arn.extract(''{account_arn}assumed-role/'')" " + ''assumed-role/''"
                  " + assertion.arn.extract(''assumed-role/{role_name}/'')" " : assertion.arn",
                  } ``` If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include
                  a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC providers,
                  you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the `google.subject`
                  attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub` claim of the
                  incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google token:
                  ``` {"google.subject": "assertion.sub"} ```'

                  expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field
                  and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor
                  must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax
                  of the extractor expression is the same as for the `value_extractor`
                  field. The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the
                  label descriptor. If the either the extraction or the type conversion
                  fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for
                  a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and
                  for a boolean label its `false`. Note that there are upper bounds

                  a DELTA metric kind, INT64 value type, with no labels and a unit
                  of "1". Such a metric counts the number of log entries matching
                  the `filter` expression. The `name`, `type`, and `description` fields
                  in the `metric_descriptor` are output only, and is constructed using
                  the `name` and `description` field in the LogMetric. To create a
                  logs-based metric that records a distribution of log values, a DELTA
                  metric kind with a DISTRIBUTION value type must be used along with
                  a `value_extractor` expression in the LogMetric. Each label in the
                  metric descriptor must have a matching label name as the key and
                  an extractor expression as the value in the `label_extractors` map.
                  The `metric_kind` and `value_type` fields in the `metric_descriptor`
                  cannot be updated once initially configured. New labels can be added
                  in the `metric_descriptor`, but existing labels cannot be modified

                      no matter how it might be displayed. If you want a custom metric
                      to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you
                      can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}`
                      (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005
                      CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`. Alternatively,
                      if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular
                      way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit`
                      is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`),
                      or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`).
                      The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units
                      of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:
                      **Basic units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second
                      * `min` minute * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes
                      (PREFIX)** * `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9)
                      * `T` tera (10^12) * `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z`
                      zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta (10^24) * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u`
                      micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9) * `p` pico (10^-12) * `f` femto
                      (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z` zepto (10^-21) * `y` yocto
                      (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi (2^20) * `Gi` gibi (2^30)
                      * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar
                      also includes these connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as
                      an infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms`
                      (although you should almost never have `/s` in a metric `unit`;
                      rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying
                      cumulative or delta value). * `.` multiplication or composition
                      (as an infix operator). For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`.
                      The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component:
                      { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX
                      ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation
                      = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if
                      it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation is used alone, then the
                      unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`,
                      `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank
                      printable ASCII characters not containing `{` or `}`. * `1`
                      represents a unitary [dimensionless unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity)
                      of 1, such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the
                      basic units are appropriate. For example, "new users per day"
                      can be represented as `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric
                      value `5` would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands
                      of page views per day" would be represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d`
                      or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3` would mean
                      "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless value
                      of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric
                      values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value
                      `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains
                      a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied
                      by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value `0.03`
                      means "3 percent").'

                  a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record
                  from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction:
                  `EXTRACT(field)` or `REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex)`. The argument
                  are: 1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value
                  is to be extracted. 2. regex: A regular expression using the Google
                  RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single
                  capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field.
                  The value of the field is converted to a string before applying
                  the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include
                  exactly one capture group. The result of the extraction must be
                  convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records
                  double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double
                  fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution. Example:

                                      is in a danger state if x is less than or equal
                                      to a danger threshold that triggers below, or

                                      then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless

                                      warning.)  As an example, consider a scorecard

                                      ''ABOVE'', }, {   value: 10,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:
                                      ''BELOW'', }, {   value: 20,   category: ''WARNING'',   trigger:

                                      to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state,

                                      to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.

                                            this field is ignored.

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.
                                            If `cross_series_reducer` is not defined,
                                            this field is ignored.

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.

                                    to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state,

                                                The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                                the time series are partitioned into

                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each
                                                individual time series is a member
                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                                is applied to each subset of time

                                                into a single output time series.

                                      is in a danger state if x is less than or equal
                                      to a danger threshold that triggers below, or

                                      then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless

                                      warning.)  As an example, consider a scorecard
                                      with the following four thresholds: {   value:

                                      ''ABOVE'', }, {   value: 10,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:

                                      to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state,

                  is only applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or
                  `DISTRIBUTION`. The `unit` defines the representation of the stored
                  metric values. Different systems might scale the values to be more
                  easily displayed (so a value of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed as
                  `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`).
                  However, if the `unit` is `kBy`, then the value of the metric is
                  always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.
                  If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds
                  used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose
                  `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the
                  job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`.
                  Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more
                  granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose
                  `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is
                  `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`).
                  The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units
                  of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard: **Basic
                  units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second * `min` minute
                  * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes (PREFIX)** *
                  `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12)
                  * `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z` zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta
                  (10^24) * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9)
                  * `p` pico (10^-12) * `f` femto (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z`
                  zepto (10^-21) * `y` yocto (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi
                  (2^20) * `Gi` gibi (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50)
                  **Grammar** The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division
                  or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or
                  `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never have `/s` in a metric
                  `unit`; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying
                  cumulative or delta value). * `.` multiplication or composition
                  (as an infix operator). For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The
                  grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component: { "."
                  Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT |
                  "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME
                  "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`.
                  If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to
                  `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`.
                  * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
                  containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless
                  unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1,
                  such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units
                  are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented
                  as `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5
                  new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would
                  be represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a
                  metric value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%`
                  represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving
                  a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of
                  0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates
                  a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will
                  be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric
                  value `0.03` means "3 percent").'

                  then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires
                  verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that
                  the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED,
                  it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification
                  or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification
                  because it was created prior to verification being required for

                  UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this
                  field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

                description: 'Required. Service hostnames with an optional port for
                  which this route describes traffic. Format: [:] Hostname is the
                  fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches the
                  RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions: - IPs
                  are not allowed. - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label
                  (*.). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label.
                  Hostname can be “precise” which is a domain name without the terminating
                  dot of a network host (e.g. “foo.example.com”) or “wildcard”, which
                  is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com).
                  Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower
                  case alphanumeric characters or ‘-’, and must start and end with
                  an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The
                  routes associated with a Router must have unique hostnames. If you
                  attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the
                  configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable
                  for routes for the hostnames "*.foo.bar.com" and "*.bar.com" to
                  be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate
                  two routes both with "*.bar.com" or both with "bar.com". In the
                  case that multiple routes match the hostname, the most specific
                  match will be selected. For example, "foo.bar.baz.com" will take
                  precedence over "*.bar.baz.com" and "*.bar.baz.com" will take precedence
                  over "*.baz.com". If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must
                  use the channel URI with the port to match this rule (i.e. "xds:///service:123"),
                  otherwise they must supply the URI without a port (i.e. "xds:///service").'

                description: Specifies the VMs that are assigned this policy. This
                  allows you to target sets or groups of VMs by different parameters
                  such as labels, names, OS, or zones. Empty assignments will target
                  ALL VMs underneath this policy. Conflict Management Policies that
                  exist higher up in the resource hierarchy (closer to the Org) will
                  override those lower down if there is a conflict. At the same level
                  in the resource hierarchy (ie. within a project), the service will
                  prevent the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each
                  other. If there are multiple policies that specify the same config
                  (eg. package, software recipe, repository, etc.), the service will
                  ensure that no VM could potentially receive instructions from both
                  policies. To create multiple policies that specify different versions
                  of a package or different configs for different Operating Systems,
                  each policy must be mutually exclusive in their targeting according
                  to labels, OS, or other criteria. Different configs are identified
                  for conflicts in different ways. Packages are identified by their
                  name and the package manager(s) they target. Package repositories
                  are identified by their unique id where applicable. Some package
                  managers don't have a unique identifier for repositories and where
                  that's the case, no uniqueness is validated by the service. Note
                  that if OS Inventory is disabled, a VM will not be assigned a policy
                  that targets by OS because the service will see this VM's OS as
                  unknown.

                  subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
                  pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The

                  If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

                  For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout

                  If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system

                      Endpoint configuration attributes.

                      Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                      be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

                      The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                      can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                      attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                      the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                      (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
                      based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

                      If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                      it will default to the version of the API used to make
                      such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                      call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                      calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                      subscription was created without this attribute.

                      The possible values for this attribute are:

                      - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
                      - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
