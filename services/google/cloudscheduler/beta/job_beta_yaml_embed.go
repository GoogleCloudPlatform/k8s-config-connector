For\n                example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s,\n                and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in\n                10s.

Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously\n            outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th\n            execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until\n            16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`.
