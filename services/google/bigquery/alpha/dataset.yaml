            will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus the

            not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given table is reached,
            that table will be deleted automatically. If a table's expirationTime
            is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an
            explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence
            over the default expiration time indicated by this property.
