# NOTE: This test assumes a volume named "test-volume" and a LUN named "test-lun" already exist in the "us-central1" region.
#       BMS LUN creation and deletion are not available through gcloud commands, so we can't create/delete them in this test.
- exec: gcloud bms volumes luns list --volume=test-volume --region=us-central1
- exec: gcloud bms volumes luns describe test-lun --volume=test-volume --region=us-central1
