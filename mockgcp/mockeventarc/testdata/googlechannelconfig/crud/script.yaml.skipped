## TODO: skip this test
## gcloud behaviour depends on version
## The presubmits test gcloud version has inconsistent behaviour with the number of get requests
## This is causing the test to fail. 
## Gemma tried fixing extra GET requests in: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/pull/4229
## But sometimes the extra GET is not called by gcloud causing http log diff
## We dont have a good solution for gcloud calling the extra GET requests
## So we are skipping the test for now

- exec: gcloud eventarc google-channels describe --location=us-central1
- exec: gcloud eventarc google-channels update --location=us-central1 --clear-crypto-key
