# 00: Create a SQLInstance with instanceType CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE
apiVersion: sql.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: SQLInstance
metadata:
  name: sqlinstance-${uniqueId}

  settings:

# 01: Add the unmanaged annotation for instanceType and attempt to change it to READ_REPLICA_INSTANCE.
# No change is expected in GCP as the field is unmanaged.
# NOTE: mockgcp will error out if we attempt to modify instanceType at this point as it's immutable once set.
