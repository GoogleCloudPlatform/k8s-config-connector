# Adding this scenario test to cover the nochange behavior in presubmit tests.
# This is because TestAllInSeries function doesn't cover the nochange test step.
#
# During the re-reconciliation / drift-correction every 5-15 minutes, commonly
# there shouldn't be any change (i.e. the "nochange") in both the KRM object and
# the underlying GCP resource, so NO PATCH/POST API call should be made to the
# underlying GCP resource. If there is a PATCH/POST call made when both the KRM
# object and the underlying GCP resource are unchanged, it means something is
# wrong in the Update logic.
