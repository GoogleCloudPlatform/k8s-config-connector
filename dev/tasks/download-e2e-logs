# This script downloads the golden output from our golden tests
# The idea is to make it easier to sync up mockgcp to the real gcp output.
# This script can currently only be run by googlers,
# because we don't expose the test results against real GCP publicly. 
# If you are not a googler and you want the output from a real test
# for some reason, please let us know!
# (But these tests are not secret, they just run the scripts in dev/ci/periodics)
