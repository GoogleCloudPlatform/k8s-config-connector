I'm writing go code . You should help me to fix the imports if possible.

The go file I want you to fix is `pkg/controller/direct/${SERVICE}/${PROTO,,}_controller.go`

Some hints:
- The import package that is named `${SERVICE}pb` is the proto API, it should come from "cloud.google.com/go" that matches ${PROTO}.
- The import that has a shortname `gcp` is the proto server, it should come from  "cloud.google.com/go" that matches ${PROTO} that matches ${PACKAGE}.

Once you are done, print the message in Json format

{"status": "success"}
