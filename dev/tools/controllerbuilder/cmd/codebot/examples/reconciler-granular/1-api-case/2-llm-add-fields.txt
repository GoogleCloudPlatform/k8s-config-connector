I'm writing go structure. You should help me.
run ```
controllerbuilder prompt --src-dir ${REPO_ROOT} --proto-dir ${REPO_ROOT}/.build/third_party/googleapis/ <<EOF
// +kcc:proto=${PROTO}
// kind: ${KIND}
EOF
```

You should parse the go code from the result.
The go code should have at least a `${KIND}Spec` go struct. If not, rerun the command, you should run at most 3 times. 

Once you get ${KIND}Spec, writeÂ the go code to ${REPO_ROOT}/apis/${SERVICE}/v1alpha1/${PROTO,,}_type.go

Some suggestions:

* Use the EditFile command to edit the ${REPO_ROOT}/apis/${SERVICE}/v1alpha1/${PROTO,,}_type.go file. If there is already a `${KIND}Spec` go struct, you should replace it.
