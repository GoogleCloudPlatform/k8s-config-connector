```
Please help me update my go.mod dependencies.  I want to update github.com/gosimple/slug to v1.15.0.

Please follow the following plan of action:

* Find all go.mod files in the repository

* For each go.mod file, update the github.com/gosimple/slug dependency.  It may not exist in every go.mod file, that is OK, there is no need to change go.mod in that case.

* Run `go mod tidy` for each directory with a go.mod file
