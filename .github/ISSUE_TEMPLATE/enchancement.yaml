      State whether you consider this request a nice-to-have, pain point, or blocker.
      Elaborate if you have any other details:
      * How would this feature/resource impact you?
      * Urgency. If this is a blocker, when would you need it by? If it's not yet a
        blocker, do you foresee it becoming a blocker at some point, and when?
