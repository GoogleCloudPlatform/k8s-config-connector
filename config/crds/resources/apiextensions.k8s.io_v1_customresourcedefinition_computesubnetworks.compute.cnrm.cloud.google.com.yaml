                  A subnet with purpose set to 'REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY' is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                  A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to 'GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY' is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                  A subnetwork with purpose set to 'PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT' reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                  Note that 'REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY' is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.
