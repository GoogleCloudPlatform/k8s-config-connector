                           This encapsulates both the version of Cloud Composer functionality and the
                           version of Apache Airflow. It must match the regular expression

                           When used as input, the server also checks if the provided version is
                           supported and denies the request for an unsupported version.

                           The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a full
                           [semantic version](https://semver.org), or an alias in the form of major
                           version number or `latest`. When an alias is provided, the server replaces
                           it with the current Cloud Composer version that satisfies the alias.

                           The Apache Airflow portion of the image version is a full semantic version
                           that points to one of the supported Apache Airflow versions, or an alias in
                           the form of only major or major.minor versions specified. When an alias is
                           provided, the server replaces it with the latest Apache Airflow version
                           that satisfies the alias and is supported in the given Cloud Composer
                           version.

                           In all cases, the resolved image version is stored in the same field.
