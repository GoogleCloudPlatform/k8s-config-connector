                  A condition which determines whether an asset update should be published.
                   If specified, an asset will be returned only when the expression evaluates
                   to true.
                   When set, `expression` field in the `Expr` must be a valid [CEL expression]
                   (https://github.com/google/cel-spec) on a TemporalAsset with name
                   `temporal_asset`. Example: a Feed with expression ("temporal_asset.deleted
                   == true") will only publish Asset deletions. Other fields of `Expr` are
                   optional.
