                             Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth limitation of 3GB/S for
                             GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S while doing a restore. Given the amount
                             of parallel backups and restore we are targeting, this will potentially
                             take the backup time to mins and hours (in worst case scenario).

                             of parallel backups and restore we are targeting, this will potentially
                             take the backup time to mins and hours (in worst case scenario).
