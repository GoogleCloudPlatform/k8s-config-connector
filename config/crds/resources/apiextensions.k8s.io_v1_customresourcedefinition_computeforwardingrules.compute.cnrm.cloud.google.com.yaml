                  When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule
                  directs the traffic to the referenced target or backendService.
                  While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required
                  under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy
                  and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be
                  set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google
                  APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally
                  specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved)
                  IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral
                  IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address
                  while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
                  * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL,
                  as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name
                  * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name

                  - address-name The forwarding rule''s target or backendService,
                  and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type
                  of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP
                  address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
                  When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address
                  number.'
