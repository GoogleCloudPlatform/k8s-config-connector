                  regional).

                  When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
                  rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
                  rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding

                  same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional
                  forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule
                  supports either IPv4 or IPv6.

                  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC

                  internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP
                  range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

                  balancers, Traffic Director, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
                  Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
                  [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
                  for details.

                  Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to
                  the backends configured with this forwarding rule.

                  The 'ports' and 'port_range' fields are mutually exclusive.

                  For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
                  same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have
                  overlapping 'portRange's.

                  For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
                  forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]'
                  pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's.

                  * If 'IPProtocol' is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP.
                  * By internal TCP/UDP load balancers, backend service-based network load
                  balancers, internal protocol forwarding and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.

                  You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by commas.
                  The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous. Only packets addressed to
                  these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
                  forwarding rule.

                  For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
                  same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot share any values
                  defined in 'ports'.

                  character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
                  must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last

                  Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example,
                  1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
