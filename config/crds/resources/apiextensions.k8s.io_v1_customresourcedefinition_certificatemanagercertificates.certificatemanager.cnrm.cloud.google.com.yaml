                  DEFAULT: Certificates with default scope are served from core Google data centers.

                  EDGE_CACHE: Certificates with scope EDGE_CACHE are special-purposed certificates,
                  served from non-core Google data centers.

                  ALL_REGIONS: Certificates with ALL_REGIONS scope are served from all GCP regions (You can only use ALL_REGIONS with global certs).
