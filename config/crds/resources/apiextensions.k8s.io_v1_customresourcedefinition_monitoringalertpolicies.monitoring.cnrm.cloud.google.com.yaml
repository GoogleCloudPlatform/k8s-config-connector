                             projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID]/conditions/[CONDITION_ID]

                         `[CONDITION_ID]` is assigned by Cloud Monitoring when the
                         condition is created as part of a new or updated alerting policy.

                         When calling the
                         [alertPolicies.create][google.monitoring.v3.AlertPolicyService.CreateAlertPolicy]

                         requested alerting policy. Cloud Monitoring creates the
                         condition identifiers and includes them in the new policy.

                         method to update a policy, including a condition `name` causes the
                         existing condition to be updated. Conditions without names are added to

                         Best practice is to preserve `[CONDITION_ID]` if you make only small
                         changes, such as those to condition thresholds, durations, or trigger
                         values.  Otherwise, treat the change as a new condition and let the
                         existing condition be deleted.

                description: Documentation that is included with notifications and
                  incidents related to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation
                  to include information to help responders understand, mitigate,
                  escalate, and correct the underlying problems detected by the alerting
                  policy. Notification channels that have limited capacity might not
                  show this documentation.

                       to 255 bytes or shorter at the latest UTF-8 character boundary. The

                       It is both the limit imposed by some third-party ticketing products and
                       it is common to define textual fields in databases as VARCHAR(255).

                       The contents of the subject line can be [templatized by using
