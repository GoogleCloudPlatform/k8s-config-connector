                  To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent,
                  you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than the threshold
                  value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be
                  triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the
                  default of 0.3 is used.
