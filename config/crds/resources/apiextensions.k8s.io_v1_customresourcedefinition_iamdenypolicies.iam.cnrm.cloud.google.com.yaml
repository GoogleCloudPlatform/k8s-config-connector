                             * `principalSet://goog/public:all`: A special identifier that represents
                               any principal that is on the internet, even if they do not have a Google
                               Account or are not logged in.

                             * `principal://goog/subject/{email_id}`: A specific Google Account.
                               Includes Gmail, Cloud Identity, and Google Workspace user accounts. For
                               example, `principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com`.

                             * `deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}`: A specific
                               Google Account that was deleted recently. For example,
                               `deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
                               the Google Account is recovered, this identifier reverts to the standard
                               identifier for a Google Account.

                             * `principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}`: A Google group. For example,
                               `principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com`.

                             * `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}?uid={uid}`: A Google group
                               that was deleted recently. For example,
                               `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
                               the Google group is restored, this identifier reverts to the standard
                               identifier for a Google group.

                             * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}`:
                               A Google Cloud service account. For example,
                               `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

                             * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}`:
                               A Google Cloud service account that was deleted recently. For example,
                               `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com?uid=1234567890`.
                               If the service account is undeleted, this identifier reverts to the
                               standard identifier for a service account.

                             * `principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/{customer_id}`: All of the
                               principals associated with the specified Google Workspace or Cloud
                               Identity customer ID. For example,

                             denied.

                             The excluded permissions can be specified using the same syntax as
                             `denied_permissions`.

                             listed in the `denied_principals`. For example, you could add a Google
                             group to the `denied_principals`, then exclude specific users who belong to
                             that group.

                             excluding `principalSet://goog/public:all`, which represents all users on
