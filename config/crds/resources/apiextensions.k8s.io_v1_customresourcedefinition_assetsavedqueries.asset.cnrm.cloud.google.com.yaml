                               highly recommend you use

                               RPC instead.

                               For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
                               permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has
                               iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA,
                               and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P
                               to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the
                               Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be
                               included in

                               Another example, if the request analyzes for who has
                               permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there's an IAM policy states
                               user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA,
                               and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P
                               to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the
                               Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be
                               included in

                               Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis:

                               * `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`

                               * `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation`

                               resource hierarchy.

                               For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
                               permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google
                               Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with
                               permission P.

                               resources cannot be used together with this option.

                               For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on
                               a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include
                               all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource.

                               If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for

                               to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the

                               Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis:

                               For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has
                               permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google
                               Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with
                               permission P.

                               [IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector][google.cloud.asset.v1.IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector]

                               specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy.
                               Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization
                               resources cannot be used together with this option.

                               For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on
                               a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include
                               all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource.

                               If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for
                               AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for
                               AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][].
