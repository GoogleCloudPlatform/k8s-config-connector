                  Optional. Condition can either be a principal condition or a resource
                   condition. It depends on the type of target, the policy it is attached to,
                   and/or the expression itself. When set, the `expression` field in the
                   `Expr` must include from 1 to 10 subexpressions, joined by the "||"(Logical
                   OR),
                   "&&"(Logical AND) or "!"(Logical NOT) operators and cannot contain more
                   than 250 characters.
                   Allowed operations for principal.subject:

                   - `principal.subject == <principal subject string>`
                   - `principal.subject != <principal subject string>`
                   - `principal.subject in [<list of principal subjects>]`
                   - `principal.subject.startsWith(<string>)`
                   - `principal.subject.endsWith(<string>)`

                   Allowed operations for principal.type:

                   - `principal.type == <principal type string>`
                   - `principal.type != <principal type string>`
                   - `principal.type in [<list of principal types>]`

                   Supported principal types are Workspace, Workforce Pool, Workload Pool and
                   Service Account. Allowed string must be one of:

                   - iam.googleapis.com/WorkspaceIdentity
                   - iam.googleapis.com/WorkforcePoolIdentity
                   - iam.googleapis.com/WorkloadPoolIdentity
                   - iam.googleapis.com/ServiceAccount

                   When the bound policy is a principal access boundary policy, the only
                   supported attributes in any subexpression are `principal.type` and
                   `principal.subject`. An example expression is: "principal.type ==
                   'iam.googleapis.com/ServiceAccount'" or "principal.subject ==
                   'bob@example.com'".
