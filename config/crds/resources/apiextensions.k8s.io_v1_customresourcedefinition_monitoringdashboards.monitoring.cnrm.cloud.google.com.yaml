                                      current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard
                                      is in a danger state if x is less than or equal
                                      to a danger threshold that triggers below, or

                                      that triggers above. Similarly, if x is above/below

                                      then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless

                                      warning.)  As an example, consider a scorecard
                                      with the following four thresholds: {   value:

                                      ''ABOVE'', }, {   value: 10,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:

                                      to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state,

                                      to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between

                                            can yield a time series with a different
                                            `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the
                                            input time series.  Time series data must
                                            first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`)
                                            in order to perform cross-time series

                                            be specified, and must not be `ALIGN_NONE`.
                                            An `alignment_period` must also be specified;

                                            when `cross_series_reducer` is specified.
                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.
                                            If `cross_series_reducer` is not defined,
                                            this field is ignored.

                                            all the data points in an `alignment_period`
                                            to be mathematically grouped together,
                                            resulting in a single data point for each

                                            original time series. Alignment can change

                                            of the time series.  Time series data
                                            must be aligned in order to perform cross-time

                                                  the value of each data point in
                                                  the resulting series is a function
                                                  of all the already aligned values
                                                  in the input time series.  Not all
                                                  reducer operations can be applied
                                                  to all time series. The valid choices
                                                  depend on the `metric_kind` and

                                                  time series. Reduction can yield
                                                  a time series with a different `metric_kind`
                                                  or `value_type` than the input time

                                                  the value of each data point in
                                                  the resulting series is a function
                                                  of all the already aligned values
                                                  in the input time series.  Not all

                                                  of all the already aligned values
                                                  in the input time series.  Not all

                                                  to all time series. The valid choices
                                                  depend on the `metric_kind` and

                                                  time series. Reduction can yield
                                                  a time series with a different `metric_kind`

                                    ''ABOVE'', }, {   value: 10,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:
                                    ''BELOW'', }, {   value: 20,   category: ''WARNING'',   trigger:
                                    ''BELOW'', }  Then: values less than or equal
                                    to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state,
                                    values greater than 10 but less than or equal

                                                The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                                the time series are partitioned into

                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each

                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                                is applied to each subset of time

                                                then the time series are aggregated
                                                into a single output time series.

                                      current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard
                                      is in a danger state if x is less than or equal
                                      to a danger threshold that triggers below, or

                                      that triggers above. Similarly, if x is above/below

                                      then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless
                                      x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps
                                      warning.)  As an example, consider a scorecard
                                      with the following four thresholds: {   value:
                                      90,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger: ''ABOVE'',
                                      },: {   value: 70,   category: ''WARNING'',   trigger:
                                      ''ABOVE'', }, {   value: 10,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:
                                      ''BELOW'', }, {   value: 20,   category: ''WARNING'',   trigger:
                                      ''BELOW'', }  Then: values less than or equal
                                      to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state,
                                      values greater than 10 but less than or equal
                                      to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between
                                      20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or

                                                        Alignment can change the `metric_kind`
