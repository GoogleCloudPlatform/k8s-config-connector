                  * SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP for an address that can be used by multiple
                  internal load balancers.

                  * VPC_PEERING for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.

                  * IPSEC_INTERCONNECT for addresses created from a private IP range that
                  are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect
                  configuration. These addresses are regional resources.

                  * PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT for a private network address that is used to
                  configure Private Service Connect. Only global internal addresses can use
                  this purpose.
