                  Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud
                   resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and
                   deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of
                   resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
                   And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
                   firewall, load balancing, etc.).

                    * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
                      the following regular expression: `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}`.
                    * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
                      to the regular expression: `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
                    * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.

                   See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.

                   If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
                   characters may be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use
                   an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
                   specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
                   as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
                   allow "_" in a future release.
