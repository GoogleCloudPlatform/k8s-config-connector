                  provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
                  snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).

                  Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                  the disk.

                  If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                  the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
                  you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
