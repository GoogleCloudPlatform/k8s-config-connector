                            In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range
                            of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes
                            then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority.
                            For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401
                            (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error
                            codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then
                            the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend
                            service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
