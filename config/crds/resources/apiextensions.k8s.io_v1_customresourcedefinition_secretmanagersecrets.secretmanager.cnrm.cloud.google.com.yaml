                  Custom metadata about the secret.

                  Annotations are distinct from various forms of labels. Annotations exist to allow
                  client tools to store their own state information without requiring a database.

                  Annotation keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of
                  maximum 128 bytes, begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]), and
                  may have dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics in between these
                  symbols.

                  The total size of annotation keys and values must be less than 16KiB.
