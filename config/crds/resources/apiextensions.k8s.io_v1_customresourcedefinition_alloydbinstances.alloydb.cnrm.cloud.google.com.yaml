                  For PRIMARY and SECONDARY instances, set the value to refer to the name of the associated cluster.
                  This is recommended because the instance type of primary and secondary instances is tied to the cluster type of the associated cluster.
                  If the secondary cluster is promoted to primary cluster, then the associated secondary instance also becomes primary instance.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    name: clusterName
                  For instances of type READ_POOL, set the value using external keyword.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    external: READ_POOL
                  If the instance type is SECONDARY, the delete instance operation does not delete the secondary instance but abandons it instead.
                  Use deletionPolicy = "FORCE" in the associated secondary cluster and delete the cluster forcefully to delete the secondary cluster as well its associated secondary instance.

                  Availability type of an Instance. Defaults to REGIONAL for both primary and read instances.

                  Note that primary and read instances can have different availability types.
                  Only READ_POOL instance supports ZONAL type. Users can't specify the zone for READ_POOL instance.
                  Zone is automatically chosen from the list of zones in the region specified.
                  Read pool of size 1 can only have zonal availability. Read pools with node count of 2 or more
                  can have regional availability (nodes are present in 2 or more zones in a region). Possible values: ["AVAILABILITY_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED", "ZONAL", "REGIONAL"].

                  Possible values: ["PRIMARY", "READ_POOL", "SECONDARY"]

                  For PRIMARY and SECONDARY instances, set the value to refer to the name of the associated cluster.
                  This is recommended because the instance type of primary and secondary instances is tied to the cluster type of the associated cluster.
                  If the secondary cluster is promoted to primary cluster, then the associated secondary instance also becomes primary instance.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    name: clusterName
                  For instances of type READ_POOL, set the value using external keyword.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    external: READ_POOL
                  If the instance type is SECONDARY, the delete instance operation does not delete the secondary instance but abandons it instead.
                  Use deletionPolicy = "FORCE" in the associated secondary cluster and delete the cluster forcefully to delete the secondary cluster as well its associated secondary instance.
