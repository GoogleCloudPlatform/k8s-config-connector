                  attachment. Can only be specified at attachment creation for PARTNER or
                  DEDICATED attachments.

                  * NONE - This is the default value, which means that the VLAN attachment
                  carries unencrypted traffic. VMs are able to send traffic to, or receive
                  traffic from, such a VLAN attachment.

                  * IPSEC - The VLAN attachment carries only encrypted traffic that is
                  encrypted by an IPsec device, such as an HA VPN gateway or third-party
                  IPsec VPN. VMs cannot directly send traffic to, or receive traffic from,
                  such a VLAN attachment. To use HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, the VLAN

                    Immutable. The addresses that have been reserved for the
                    interconnect attachment. Used only for interconnect attachment that
                    has the encryption option as IPSEC.

                    The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
                    VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
                    configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
                    address will be allocated from the IP address range specified
                    here.

                    For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
                    interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN
                    gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified
                    for this interconnect attachment.

                    If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
                    encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on
                    this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will
                    be allocated from regional external IP address pool.
