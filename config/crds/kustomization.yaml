# This kustomization.yaml is not intended to be run by itself.
# It will be copied by the `manifests` Makefile target
# and the copied file will be edited to add CRDs as resources dynamically.

# The patch is to specifically set spec.preserveUnknownFields: false
# for compatibility with apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CRDs. See more details
# here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#field-pruning
# The reason that we have to use kustomize to patch this change is because
# go-yaml library will marshal CRD structs to bytes with spec.preserveUnknownFields field omitted
# because it has the golang default value `false` for bool type.
