# Directory: config/samples

This directory contains sample YAML manifests for each Config Connector resource type.

These samples are intended to demonstrate how to use the different KCC resources. They are a great starting point for learning how to manage a particular GCP resource with KCC.

The samples are organized by GCP service and version, mirroring the structure of the `apis/` directory.

When you are trying to figure out how to write the YAML for a KCC resource, this is the first place you should look.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and `config/GEMINI.md`.
