# When a KCC managed namespace is deleted the RoleBindings in the namespace are deleted. As a result the KCC controllers
# are unable to clean up the KCC resources in the namespace. This finalizer prevents the RoleBinding deletion from
# occurring. The operator can then wait for the KCC controllers to delete all resources before removing this finalizer.
