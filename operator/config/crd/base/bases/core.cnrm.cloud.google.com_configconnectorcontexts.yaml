                description: |-
                  The actuation mode of Config Connector controls how resources are actuated onto the cloud provider.
                  This can be either 'Reconciling' or 'Paused'. The default is 'Reconciling' where resources get actuated.
                  In 'Paused', k8s resources are still reconciled with the api server but not actuated onto the cloud provider.
                enum:
                - Reconciling

              requestProjectPolicy:
                description: |-
                  Specifies which project to use for preconditions, quota, and billing for
                  requests made to Google Cloud APIs for resources in the associated
                  namespace. Must be one of 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT',
                  'RESOURCE_PROJECT', or 'BILLING_PROJECT. Defaults to 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT'. If set to
                  'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT', uses the project that the Google Service
                  Account belongs to. If set to 'RESOURCE_PROJECT', uses the project that
                  the resource belongs to. If set to 'BILLING_PROJECT', uses the project specified by spec.billingProject.

                  StateIntoSpec is the user override of the default value for the
                  'cnrm.cloud.google.com/state-into-spec' annotation if the annotation is
                  unset for a resource.
                  'Absent' means that unspecified fields in the resource spec stay
                  unspecified after successful reconciliation.
                  'Merge' means that unspecified fields in the resource spec are populated
                  after a successful reconciliation if those unspecified fields are
                  computed/defaulted by the API. It is only applicable to resources
                  supporting the 'Merge' option.
