# ConfigConnector Golden Tests

This directory contains golden tests for the `ConfigConnector` controller.
These tests verify the Kubernetes resources generated by the operator when a `ConfigConnector` resource is reconciled.

## Test Structure

Each subdirectory represents a test case:

- `input.yaml`: The `ConfigConnector` resource to be reconciled.
- `_expected.yaml`: The set of Kubernetes resources (CRDs, Deployments, Services, etc.) that the operator is expected to generate/apply.

## Running Tests

Tests are run as part of the package tests:

```bash
go test -v ./operator/pkg/controllers/configconnector/
```

## Updating Expected Output

If you make changes that legitimately change the generated resources, you can update the golden files by running:

```bash
WRITE_GOLDEN_OUTPUT=1 go test -v ./operator/pkg/controllers/configconnector/
```
