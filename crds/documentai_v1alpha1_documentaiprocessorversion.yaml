                                 - Name matching is case-sensitive.
                                 - Maximum 64 characters.
                                 - Must start with a letter.
                                 - Allowed characters: ASCII letters `[a-z0-9_-]`.  (For backward
                                   compatibility internal infrastructure and tooling can handle any ascii
                                   character.)
                                 - The `/` is sometimes used to denote a property of a type.  For example
                                   `line_item/amount`.  This convention is deprecated, but will still be
                                   honored for backward compatibility.
