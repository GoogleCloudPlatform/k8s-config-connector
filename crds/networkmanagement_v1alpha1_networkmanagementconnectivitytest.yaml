                  Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.

                  You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                  Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                  destination location.

                  Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                  location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                  endpoint from route information.

                  If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                  multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                  destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                  interface.

                  A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                  is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                  don't intend to test.

                      that you provide is from the service project. In this case, the

                      project.

                  Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.

                  You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                  (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                  source location.

                  Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                  a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                  also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                  which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                  information.

                  If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                  you must provide the destination VPC network.

                  If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                  network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                  identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                  address or VPC network.

                  A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                  ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                  you don't intend to test.
