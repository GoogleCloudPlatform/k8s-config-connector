                  Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.

                   You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine
                   VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination
                   location.

                   Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                   location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                   endpoint from route information.

                   If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                   multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either
                   a destination IP address  or VPC network to identify the destination
                   interface.

                   A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is
                   ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don't
                   intend to test.

                  Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.

                   You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                   (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify
                   the source location.

                   Examples:
                   If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud
                   Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC
                   network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its
                   internal IP address and VPC network information.

                   If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must
                   provide the destination VPC network.

                   If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                   network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the
                   endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network.

                   A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                   ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that you don't
                   intend to test.

                       You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine
                       VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination
                       location.

                       Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                       location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                       endpoint from route information.

                       If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                       multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either
                       a destination IP address  or VPC network to identify the destination
                       interface.

                       A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is
                       ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don't
                       intend to test.

                                     protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                                     one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                     the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                     `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                     (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                     In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                     expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                     scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                     server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                     * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                       value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                       breaking changes.)

                                     Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                     protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                     type.googleapis.com.

                                     Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                                     protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                                     one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                     the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                     `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                     (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                     In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                     expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                     scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                     server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                     * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                       value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                       breaking changes.)

                                     Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                     protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                     type.googleapis.com.

                                     Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                     used with implementation specific semantics.

                                     scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                     server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                     * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                     * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                       value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                     * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                       URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                       lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                       on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                       breaking changes.)

                                     Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                     protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                     type.googleapis.com.

                                     Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                     used with implementation specific semantics.

                      Source specification of the Connectivity Test.

                       You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                       (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify
                       the source location.

                       Examples:
                       If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud
                       Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC
                       network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its
                       internal IP address and VPC network information.

                       If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must
                       provide the destination VPC network.

                       If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                       network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the
                       endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network.

                       A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                       ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that you don't
                       intend to test.
