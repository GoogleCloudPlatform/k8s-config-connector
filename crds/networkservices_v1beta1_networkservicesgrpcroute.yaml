                description: 'Required. Service hostnames with an optional port for
                  which this route describes traffic. Format: [:] Hostname is the
                  fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches the
                  RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions: - IPs
                  are not allowed. - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label
                  (*.). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label.
                  Hostname can be “precise” which is a domain name without the terminating
                  dot of a network host (e.g. “foo.example.com”) or “wildcard”, which
                  is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com).
                  Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower
                  case alphanumeric characters or ‘-’, and must start and end with
                  an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The
                  routes associated with a Router must have unique hostnames. If you
                  attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the
                  configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable
                  for routes for the hostnames "*.foo.bar.com" and "*.bar.com" to
                  be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate
                  two routes both with "*.bar.com" or both with "bar.com". In the
                  case that multiple routes match the hostname, the most specific
                  match will be selected. For example, "foo.bar.baz.com" will take
                  precedence over "*.bar.baz.com" and "*.bar.baz.com" will take precedence
                  over "*.baz.com". If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must
                  use the channel URI with the port to match this rule (i.e. "xds:///service:123"),
                  otherwise they must supply the URI without a port (i.e. "xds:///service").'
