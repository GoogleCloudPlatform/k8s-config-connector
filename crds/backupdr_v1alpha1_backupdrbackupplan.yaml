                             Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth limitation of 3GB/S for
                             GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S while doing a restore. Given the amount
                             of parallel backups and restore we are targeting, this will potentially
                             take the backup time to mins and hours (in worst case scenario).
