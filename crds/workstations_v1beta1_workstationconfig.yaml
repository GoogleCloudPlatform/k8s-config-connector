                   If specified, the boot disk of the Compute Engine instance and the
                   persistent disk are encrypted using this encryption key. If
                   this field is not set, the disks are encrypted using a generated
                   key. Customer-managed encryption keys do not protect disk metadata.

                   If the customer-managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation
                   instance is stopped, the system attempts to recreate the
                   persistent disk with the new version of the key. Be sure to keep
                   older versions of the key until the persistent disk is recreated.
                   Otherwise, data on the persistent disk might be lost.

                   If the encryption key is revoked, the workstation session automatically
                   stops within 7 hours.

                           VMs created under this workstation configuration.

                           Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM) instances
                           inside your workstation. Before enabling nested virtualization,
                           consider the following important considerations. Cloud Workstations
                           instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute Engine
                           instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions):

                           * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or
                           organizations may be restricted from creating nested VMs if the
                           **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is enforced in
                           the organization policy. For more information, see the
                           Compute Engine section,
                           [Checking whether nested virtualization is
                           allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed).
                           * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater
                           decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and
                           possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are
                           input/output bound.
                           * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on
                           workstation configurations that specify a
                           [machine_type][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.Host.GceInstance.machine_type]
                           in the N1 or N2 machine series.
                           * **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on workstation
                           configurations with accelerators.
                           * **Operating System**: Because
                           [Container-Optimized
                           OS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-optimized_os_cos)

                           sure that the service account has `logginglogEntries.create` permission
                           on the project so it can write logs out to Cloud Logging. If using a
                           custom container image, the service account must have permissions to
                           pull the specified image.

                           If you as the administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the
                           underlying VM, you need to set this value to a service account
                           for which you have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission.
                           Conversely, if you don't want anyone to be able to `ssh` into the
                           underlying VM, use a service account where no one has that
                           permission.

                           If not set, VMs run with a service account provided by the
                           Cloud Workstations service, and the image must be publicly
                           accessible.

                   If specified, the boot disk of the Compute Engine instance and the
                   persistent disk are encrypted using this encryption key. If
                   this field is not set, the disks are encrypted using a generated
                   key. Customer-managed encryption keys do not protect disk metadata.

                   If the customer-managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation
                   instance is stopped, the system attempts to recreate the
                   persistent disk with the new version of the key. Be sure to keep
                   older versions of the key until the persistent disk is recreated.
                   Otherwise, data on the persistent disk might be lost.

                   If the encryption key is revoked, the workstation session automatically
                   stops within 7 hours.

                          Optional. Whether to enable nested virtualization on Cloud Workstations
                           VMs created under this workstation configuration.

                           Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM) instances
                           inside your workstation. Before enabling nested virtualization,
                           consider the following important considerations. Cloud Workstations
                           instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute Engine
                           instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions):

                           * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or
                           organizations may be restricted from creating nested VMs if the
                           **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is enforced in
                           the organization policy. For more information, see the
                           Compute Engine section,
                           [Checking whether nested virtualization is
                           allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed).
                           * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater
                           decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and
                           possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are
                           input/output bound.
                           * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on
                           workstation configurations that specify a
                           [machine_type][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.Host.GceInstance.machine_type]
                           in the N1 or N2 machine series.
                           * **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on workstation
                           configurations with accelerators.
                           * **Operating System**: Because
                           [Container-Optimized
                           OS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-optimized_os_cos)
                           does not support nested virtualization, when nested virtualization is
                           enabled, the underlying Compute Engine VM instances boot from an
                           [Ubuntu
                           LTS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts)

                           sure that the service account has `logginglogEntries.create` permission
                           on the project so it can write logs out to Cloud Logging. If using a
                           custom container image, the service account must have permissions to
                           pull the specified image.

                           If you as the administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the
                           underlying VM, you need to set this value to a service account
                           for which you have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission.
                           Conversely, if you don't want anyone to be able to `ssh` into the
                           underlying VM, use a service account where no one has that
                           permission.

                           If not set, VMs run with a service account provided by the
                           Cloud Workstations service, and the image must be publicly
                           accessible.

                  Optional. Number of seconds that a workstation can run until it is
                   automatically shut down. We recommend that workstations be shut down daily
                   to reduce costs and so that security updates can be applied upon restart.
                   The
                   [idle_timeout][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.idle_timeout]
                   and
                   [running_timeout][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.running_timeout]
                   fields are independent of each other. Note that the
                   [running_timeout][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.running_timeout]
                   field shuts down VMs after the specified time, regardless of whether or not
                   the VMs are idle.

                   Provide duration terminated by `s` for seconds—for example, `"54000s"`
                   (15 hours). Defaults to `"43200s"` (12 hours). A value of `"0s"` indicates
                   that workstations using this configuration should never time out. If
                   [encryption_key][google.cloud.workstations.v1.WorkstationConfig.encryption_key]
                   is set, it must be greater than `"0s"` and less than
                   `"86400s"` (24 hours).

                   Warning: A value of `"0s"` indicates that Cloud Workstations VMs created
                   with this configuration have no maximum running time. This is strongly
                   discouraged because you incur costs and will not pick up security updates.
