                description: 'Output only. Returns true if the Service is currently
                  being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.
                  When a new Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud
                  Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the
                  Service to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation.
                  While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`, `latest_ready_revison`,
                  `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient values that might
                  mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this
                  field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation
                  succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or there was
                  an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in
                  `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded, the following
                  fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`
                  and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`.
                  If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`,
                  and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving
                  revision, or empty for newly created Services. Additional information
