                        For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is
                        UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S))
                        and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).

                        See the [Backend Services Overview](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#balancing-mode)
                        for an explanation of load balancing modes. Default value: "UTILIZATION" Possible values: ["UTILIZATION", "RATE", "CONNECTION"].

                        Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%

                      will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections

                  The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
                  The possible values are:

                  * 'ROUND_ROBIN': This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                                   is selected in round robin order.

                  * 'LEAST_REQUEST': An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                                     hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

                  * 'RING_HASH': The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                                 hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                                 addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                                 1/N of the requests.

                  * 'RANDOM': The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

                  * 'ORIGINAL_DESTINATION': Backend host is selected based on the client
                                            connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                            to the same address as the destination address of
                                            the incoming connection before the connection
                                            was redirected to the load balancer.

                  * 'MAGLEV': used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                              Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                              build times and host selection times. For more information about

                  * 'WEIGHTED_MAGLEV': Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
                                       reported weights. If set, the Backend Service must
                                       configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
                                       health check replies are expected to contain
                                       non-standard HTTP response header field
                                       X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
                                       per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
                                       based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
                                       processed health check replies, as long as every
                                       instance either reported a valid weight or had
                                       UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
                                       equal-weight.
