                    description: Output only. The timestamp at which this database
                      was created. Databases created before 2016 do not populate create_time.

                    description: |-
                      Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions of the data can
                       be read from the database. See [version_retention_period] above; this field
                       is populated with `now - version_retention_period`.

                       This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the moment it is
                       queried. If you are using this value to recover data, make sure to account
                       for the time from the moment when the value is queried to the moment when
                       you initiate the recovery.

                      the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete
                      requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before

                    description: |-
                      Output only. The key_prefix for this database. This key_prefix is used, in
                       combination with the project id ("<key prefix>~<project id>") to construct
                       the application id that is returned from the Cloud Datastore APIs in Google
                       App Engine first generation runtimes.

                       This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for URL-encoded keys
                       is the project_id (eg: foo instead of v~foo).

                      was most recently updated. Note this only includes updates to
                      the database resource and not data contained by the database.

                  versionRetentionPeriod:
                    description: |-
                      Output only. The period during which past versions of data are retained in
                       the database.

                       Any [read][google.firestore.v1.GetDocumentRequest.read_time]
                       or [query][google.firestore.v1.ListDocumentsRequest.read_time] can specify
                       a `read_time` within this window, and will read the state of the database
                       at that time.

                       If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days. Otherwise,
                       the retention period is 1 hour.
