                          The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files
                          encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used
                          as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented
                          in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without
                          any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple
                          bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte
                          used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be
                          treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the
                          escape sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator.
                          The default value is comma (",", U+002C).

                          encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string
                          to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default
                          value is a double-quote ("). If your data does not contain
                          quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                          If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must
                          also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include
                          the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede
                          it with an additional matching quote character. For example,
                          if you want to escape the default character  ' " ', use
                          ' "" '.
