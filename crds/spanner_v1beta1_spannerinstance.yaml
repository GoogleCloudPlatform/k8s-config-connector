                  Note that the `AUTOMATIC` value isn't permitted for free instances,
                  as backups and backup schedules aren't supported for free instances.

                  In the `GetInstance` or `ListInstances` response, if the value of
                  `default_backup_schedule_type` isn't set, or set to `NONE`, Spanner doesn't
                  create a default backup schedule for new databases in the instance.

                  Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud
                  resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and
                  deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of
                  resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
                  And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
                  firewall, load balancing, etc.).

                    - Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
                      the following regular expression: `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}`.
                    - Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
                      to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
                    - No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.

                  See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.

                  If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
                  characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an
                  internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
                  specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
                  as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
                  allow "_" in a future release.
