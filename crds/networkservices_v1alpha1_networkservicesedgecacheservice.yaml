                  Some legacy HTTP clients may have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to broken HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to true will prevent HTTP/2 from being advertised and negotiated.

                            Host patterns must be valid hostnames. Ports are not allowed. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. * matches any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). It does not match the empty string.

                            When multiple hosts are specified, hosts are matched in the following priority:

                              1. Exact domain names: ''www.foo.com''.
                              2. Suffix domain wildcards: ''*.foo.com'' or ''*-bar.foo.com''.
                              3. Prefix domain wildcards: ''foo.*'' or ''foo-*''.
                              4. Special wildcard ''*'' matching any domain.

                              Notes:

                                The wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. ''*-bar.foo.com'' will match ''baz-bar.foo.com'' but not ''-bar.foo.com''. The longest wildcards match first. Only a single host in the entire service can match on ''*''. A domain must be unique across all configured hosts within a service.

                                Hosts are matched against the HTTP Host header, or for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the ":authority" header, from the incoming request.

                                You may specify up to 10 hosts.

                                          For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client. Possible values: ["CACHE_ALL_STATIC", "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS", "FORCE_CACHE_ALL", "BYPASS_CACHE"].

                                          - The TTL must be > 0 and <= 86400s (1 day)

                                          - The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 31,536,000 seconds (1 year)
                                          - Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate" (equivalent to must-revalidate)

                                          - When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses.

                                          Note that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL. Objects that expire will be revalidated with the origin.

                                          - The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 31,536,000 seconds (1 year)

                                          - Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching enabled will use the default TTLs for each status code, defined in negativeCaching.
                                          - TTLs must be >= 0 (where 0 is "always revalidate") and <= 86400s (1 day)

                                          Note that when specifying an explicit negativeCachingPolicy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. The CDNPolicy will not apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.
