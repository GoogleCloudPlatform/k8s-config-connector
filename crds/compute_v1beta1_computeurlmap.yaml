                  defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
                  Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.
                  URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction.

                      The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure.
                      As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service.
                      Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests.
                      timeout and retryPolicy is ignored by clients that are configured with a faultInjectionPolicy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection.
                      Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: [Routing and traffic management features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#routing-traffic-management).

                                * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with any 5xx response code,
                                  or if the backend service does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout,
                                * connection failure, and refused streams.
                                * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
                                * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services,
                                  for example due to connection timeouts.
                                * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                                * refused-stream:Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code.
                                  This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                                * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled
                                * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                                * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to resource-exhausted

                                      - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                                      any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                                      example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                                      streams.
                                      - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                                      502, 503 or 504.
                                      - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                                      connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                                      - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                      Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                                      - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                                      REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                                      - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                      header is set to cancelled
                                      - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                                      gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                                      - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                      header is set to resource-exhausted
                                      - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if
                                      the gRPC status code in the response header is set to unavailable.

                              For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                              in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                              that matches the request is applied.

                              You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                              Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and

                              Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                              in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which

                              future without any impact on existing rules.
