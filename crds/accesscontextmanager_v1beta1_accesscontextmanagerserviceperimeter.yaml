                  Immutable. Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                  bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                  and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                  ONE regular Service Perimeter.

                  In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                  be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                  resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                  resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                  Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                  entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

                  Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                  topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                  with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                  themselves. Default value: "PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR" Possible values: ["PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR", "PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE"].

                  Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                  for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                  Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                  implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                  configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                  This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                  actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                  between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                  bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
