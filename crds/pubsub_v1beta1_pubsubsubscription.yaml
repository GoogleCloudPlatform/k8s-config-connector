                  This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message

                  delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
                  acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
                  again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

                  For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
                  the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
                  subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
                  pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
                  maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
                  If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

                  For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
                  for the call to the push endpoint.

                  If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
                  will eventually redeliver the message.

                      Endpoint configuration attributes.

                      Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                      be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

                      The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                      can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                      attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                      the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                      (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
                      based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

                      If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                      it will default to the version of the API used to make
                      such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                      call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                      calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                      subscription was created without this attribute.

                      The possible values for this attribute are:

                      - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
                      - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
