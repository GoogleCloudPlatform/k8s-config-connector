                      service will refuse to create a snapshot that would expire in
                      less than 1 hour after creation.

                      until this time. A newly-created snapshot expires no later than
                      7 days from the time of its creation. Its exact lifetime is
                      determined at creation by the existing backlog in the source
                      subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the snapshot is
                      `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`.
                      For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message
                      is 3 days old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription,
                      the snapshot -- which will always capture this 3-day-old backlog
                      as long as the snapshot exists -- will expire in 4 days. The
                      service will refuse to create a snapshot that would expire in
                      less than 1 hour after creation.
