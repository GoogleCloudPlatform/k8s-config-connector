                      The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it

                      the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                      initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                      reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.

                      Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                      numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                      instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                      and time the startup process.

                            A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                            a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                            This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                            the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                            is exporting per-instance or per-group data.

                            You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                            You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                            any functions for each selector.
                            You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                            metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                            be identical.

                            The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                            expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                            expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                            instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                            labels.

                            If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                            this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                            instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                            point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                            This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.

                            If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.

                            You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                            one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                            (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                            TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                            will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

                            The metric cannot have negative values.

                            The metric must have a value type of INT64 or DOUBLE.

                          description: |-
                            If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                            total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                            an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                            The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                            value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                            to group resizing.

                            For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                            'pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages'
                            or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                            your instances.

                            A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                            latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                            single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                            instead.

                            maintain. This must be a positive value. A utilization
                            metric scales number of virtual machines handling requests
                            to increase or decrease proportionally to the metric.

                            For example, a good metric to use as a utilizationTarget is
                            www.googleapis.com/compute/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
                            The autoscaler will work to keep this value constant for each
