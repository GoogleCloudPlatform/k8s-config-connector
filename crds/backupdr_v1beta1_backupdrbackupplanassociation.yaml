                                       one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                       the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                       `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                       (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                       In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                       expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                       scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                       server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                       * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                       * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                         value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                       * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                         URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                         lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                         on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                         breaking changes.)

                                       Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                       protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                       type.googleapis.com.

                                       Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                       used with implementation specific semantics.

                                       one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                       the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                       `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                       (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                       In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                       expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                       scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                       server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                       * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                       * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                         value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                       * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                         URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                         lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                         on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                         breaking changes.)

                                       Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                       protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                       type.googleapis.com.

                                       Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                       used with implementation specific semantics.
