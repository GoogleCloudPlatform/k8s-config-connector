                  expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication
                  credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression
                  must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation.
                  The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * `assertion`:
                  JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider.
                  * `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the
                  `attribute_mappings`. * `attribute`: The custom attributes mapped
                  from the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`. The maximum length
                  of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified,
                  all valid authentication credential are accepted. The following
                  example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped `google.groups`
                  value of `admins`: ``` "''admins'' in google.groups" ```'

                description: 'Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued
                  by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such
                  as `subject` and `segment`. Each key must be a string specifying
                  the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are
                  supported: * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating.
                  You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject
                  that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 characters.
                  * `google.groups`: Groups the external identity belongs to. You
                  can grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet`
                  binding; access applies to all members of the group. You can also
                  provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`,
                  where `{custom_attribute}` is the name of the custom attribute to
                  be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The
                  maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and
                  the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference
                  these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for
                  a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: * `google.subject`:
                  `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value}`
                  * `google.groups`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/group/{value}`
                  * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}`
                  Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel)
                  function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized
                  attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the
                  `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation
                  of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum
                  length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When
                  evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed
                  8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the
                  following default mapping applies: ``` { "google.subject":"assertion.arn",
                  "attribute.aws_role": "assertion.arn.contains(''assumed-role'')"
                  " ? assertion.arn.extract(''{account_arn}assumed-role/'')" " + ''assumed-role/''"
                  " + assertion.arn.extract(''assumed-role/{role_name}/'')" " : assertion.arn",
                  } ``` If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include
                  a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC providers,
                  you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the `google.subject`
                  attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub` claim of the
                  incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google token:
                  ``` {"google.subject": "assertion.sub"} ```'
