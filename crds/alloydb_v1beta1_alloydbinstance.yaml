                  For PRIMARY and SECONDARY instances, set the value to refer to the name of the associated cluster.
                  This is recommended because the instance type of primary and secondary instances is tied to the cluster type of the associated cluster.
                  If the secondary cluster is promoted to primary cluster, then the associated secondary instance also becomes primary instance.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    name: clusterName
                  For instances of type READ_POOL, set the value using external keyword.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    external: READ_POOL
                  If the instance type is SECONDARY, the delete instance operation does not delete the secondary instance but abandons it instead.
                  Use deletionPolicy = "FORCE" in the associated secondary cluster and delete the cluster forcefully to delete the secondary cluster as well its associated secondary instance.

                  For PRIMARY and SECONDARY instances, set the value to refer to the name of the associated cluster.
                  This is recommended because the instance type of primary and secondary instances is tied to the cluster type of the associated cluster.
                  If the secondary cluster is promoted to primary cluster, then the associated secondary instance also becomes primary instance.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    name: clusterName
                  For instances of type READ_POOL, set the value using external keyword.
                  Example:
                  instanceTypeRef:
                    external: READ_POOL
                  If the instance type is SECONDARY, the delete instance operation does not delete the secondary instance but abandons it instead.
                  Use deletionPolicy = "FORCE" in the associated secondary cluster and delete the cluster forcefully to delete the secondary cluster as well its associated secondary instance.
