                          in the Membership returned from a successful long-running
                          operation from CreateMembership or UpdateMembership. It
                          is not populated during normal GetMembership or ListMemberships
                          requests. To get the resource manifest after the initial
                          registration, the caller should make a UpdateMembership
                          call with an empty field mask.
