                           The Apache Airflow portion of the image version is a full semantic version
                           that points to one of the supported Apache Airflow versions, or an alias in
                           the form of only major or major.minor versions specified. When an alias is
                           provided, the server replaces it with the latest Apache Airflow version
                           that satisfies the alias and is supported in the given Cloud Composer
                           version.

                           In all cases, the resolved image version is stored in the same field.
