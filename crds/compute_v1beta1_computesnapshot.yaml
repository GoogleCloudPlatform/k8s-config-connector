                  Immutable. Encrypts the snapshot using a customer-supplied encryption key.

                  After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied key, you must
                  provide the same key if you use the snapshot later. For example, you
                  must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from the
                  encrypted snapshot in a future request.

                  Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                  the snapshot.

                  If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot,
                  then the snapshot will be encrypted using an automatically generated
                  key and you do not need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.
