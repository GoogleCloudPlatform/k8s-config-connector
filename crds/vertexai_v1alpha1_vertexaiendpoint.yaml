                              to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed
                              (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel
                              increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle,
                              a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value
                              is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default
                              value. The value of this field impacts the charge against
                              Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be
                              charged for max_replica_count * number of cores in the
                              selected machine type) and (max_replica_count * number
                              of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).

                              must be greater than or equal to 1. If traffic against
                              the DeployedModel increases, it may dynamically be deployed
                              onto more replicas, and as traffic decreases, some of
                              these extra replicas may be freed.
