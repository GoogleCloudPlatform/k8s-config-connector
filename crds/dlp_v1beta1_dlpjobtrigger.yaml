                                          will be included in the window, so that
                                          hotwords may be used to match substrings
                                          of the finding itself. For example, the
                                          certainty of a phone number regex "(d{3})

                                  The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                  "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually
                                  precompile into the binary all types that they expect
                                  it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                                  which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme,
                                  one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                  type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If
                                  no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An
                                  HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications
                                  are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid
                                  any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs
                                  to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned
                                  type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this
