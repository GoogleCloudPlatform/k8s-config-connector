                  Output only. Returns true if the Job is currently being acted upon by the
                  system to bring it into the desired state.

                  When a new Job is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run
                  will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Job to the
                  desired state. This process is called reconciliation.
                  While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation` and
                  `latest_succeeded_execution`, will have transient values that might
                  mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is
                  false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the
                  state matches the Job, or there was an error,  and reconciliation failed.
                  This state can be found in `terminal_condition.state`.

                  If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match:
                  `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_succeeded_execution` and
                  `latest_created_execution`.

                  If reconciliation failed, `observed_generation` and
                  `latest_succeeded_execution` will have the state of the last succeeded
                  execution or empty for newly created Job. Additional information on the
                  failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.
