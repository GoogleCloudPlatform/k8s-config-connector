                  Existing Google Groups can have an additional label with a key of cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.security and an empty value added to them. This is an immutable change and the security label cannot be removed once added.

                  Dynamic groups have a label with a key of cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.dynamic.
