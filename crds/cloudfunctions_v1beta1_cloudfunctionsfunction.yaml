                      Immutable. Required. The type of event to observe. For example:

                      Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`.
                      The pattern contains:

                      1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and
                         `google.firebase.analytics`.
                      2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For
                         example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`.
                      3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for
                         a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'.
                      These parts are lower case.

                          Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example,

                          Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For
                          example:

                          1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
                             only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
                             same project as the `Function`.
                          2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
                             `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
                             `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
                             that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

                          Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
                          `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long"
                          format.

                          See each *service's* documentation for supported formats.
