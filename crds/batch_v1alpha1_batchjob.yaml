                             project-level SSH keys from accessing this job's VMs.  Alternatively, you
                             can configure the job to specify a VM instance template that blocks
                             project-level SSH keys. In either case, Batch blocks project-level SSH
                             keys while creating the VMs for this job.

                             Batch allows project-level SSH keys for a job's VMs only if all
                             the following are true:

                               SSH keys.

                             Notably, you can override this behavior by manually updating a VM to
                             block or allow project-level SSH keys. For more information about
                             blocking project-level SSH keys, see the Compute Engine documentation:

                                     If the `type` specifies a local SSD, this field should be a multiple of
                                     375 GB, otherwise, the final size will be the next greater multiple of
                                     375 GB.

                                     image and task requirements if you do not speicify the size.
                                     If both this field and the `boot_disk_mib` field in task spec's
                                     `compute_resource` are defined, Batch will only honor this field.
                                     Also, this field should be no smaller than the source disk's
                                     size when the `data_source` is set as `snapshot` or `image`.
                                     For example, if you set an image as the `data_source` field and the
                                     image's default disk size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the
                                     disk larger or equal to 30 GB.

                                           If the `type` specifies a persistent disk, this field
                                           is ignored if `data_source` is set as `image` or `snapshot`.
                                           If the `type` specifies a local SSD, this field should be a multiple of
                                           375 GB, otherwise, the final size will be the next greater multiple of
                                           375 GB.

                                           **Boot Disk**:
                                           Batch will calculate the boot disk size based on source
                                           image and task requirements if you do not speicify the size.
                                           If both this field and the `boot_disk_mib` field in task spec's
                                           `compute_resource` are defined, Batch will only honor this field.
                                           Also, this field should be no smaller than the source disk's
                                           size when the `data_source` is set as `snapshot` or `image`.
                                           For example, if you set an image as the `data_source` field and the
                                           image's default disk size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the
                                           disk larger or equal to 30 GB.

                                  By default, after a Runnable fails, no further Runnable are executed. This

                                  Normally, a runnable that doesn't exit causes its task to fail. However,
                                   you can set this field to `true` to configure a background runnable.
                                   Background runnables are allowed continue running in the background while
                                   the task executes subsequent runnables. For example, background runnables
                                   are useful for providing services to other runnables or providing
                                   debugging-support tools like SSH servers.

                                   Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically (if they have
                                   not already exited) a short time after all foreground runnables have
                                   completed. Even though this is likely to result in a non-zero exit status
                                   for the background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated as task
                                   failures.

                                       When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container
                                       runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker.

                                      example, `--network host`. For the `--volume`
                                      option, use the `volumes` field for the container.

                                      Required if the container image is from a private Docker registry. The
                                       username to login to the Docker registry that contains the image.

                                       You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or
                                       specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret:
                                       `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is
                                       recommended for enhanced security.

                                       Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the
                                       username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs.
                                       To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the username instead.

                                       into the container, formatted to match `--volume` option for the
                                       `docker run` command&mdash;for example, `/foo:/bar` or `/foo:/bar:ro`.

                                       If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch
                                       will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the
                                       same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for
                                       containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and
                                       read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original
                                       mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different
                                       mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.
