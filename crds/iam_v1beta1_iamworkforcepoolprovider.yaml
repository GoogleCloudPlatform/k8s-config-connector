                  * `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the

                  the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are
                  supported: * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating.
                  You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject
                  that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and
                  the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups
                  the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access
                  to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies
                  to all members of the group. * `google.display_name`: The name of
                  the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped
                  display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, `google.subject`
                  will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in
                  IAM bindings. * `google.profile_photo`: The URL that specifies the
                  authenticated user''s thumbnail photo. This is an optional field.
                  When set, the image will be visible as the user''s profile picture.
                  If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead. This
                  attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. You can also provide

                  where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to
                  be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The
                  maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and
                  the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference
                  these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for
                  a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources. For example:'
