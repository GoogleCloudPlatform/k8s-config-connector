                  * `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the

                  the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are

                  You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject
                  that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and
                  the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups
                  the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access
                  to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies
                  to all members of the group. * `google.display_name`: The name of
                  the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped
                  display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, `google.subject`
                  will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in
                  IAM bindings. * `google.profile_photo`: The URL that specifies the
                  authenticated user''s thumbnail photo. This is an optional field.
                  When set, the image will be visible as the user''s profile picture.

                  maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and
                  the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference
                  these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for
