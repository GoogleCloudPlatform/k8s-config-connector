                  from the time of its creation. Its exact lifetime is determined
                  at creation by the existing backlog in the source subscription.
                  Specifically, the lifetime of the snapshot is `7 days - (age of
                  oldest unacked message in the subscription)`. For example, consider
                  a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days old. If a
                  snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which
                  will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot
                  exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create
                  a snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation.
