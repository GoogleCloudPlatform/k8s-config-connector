              assignment:
                description: Specifies the VMs that are assigned this policy. This
                  allows you to target sets or groups of VMs by different parameters
                  such as labels, names, OS, or zones. Empty assignments will target
                  ALL VMs underneath this policy. Conflict Management Policies that
                  exist higher up in the resource hierarchy (closer to the Org) will
                  override those lower down if there is a conflict. At the same level
                  in the resource hierarchy (ie. within a project), the service will
                  prevent the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each
                  other. If there are multiple policies that specify the same config
                  (eg. package, software recipe, repository, etc.), the service will
                  ensure that no VM could potentially receive instructions from both
                  policies. To create multiple policies that specify different versions
                  of a package or different configs for different Operating Systems,
                  each policy must be mutually exclusive in their targeting according
                  to labels, OS, or other criteria. Different configs are identified
                  for conflicts in different ways. Packages are identified by their
                  name and the package manager(s) they target. Package repositories
                  are identified by their unique id where applicable. Some package
                  managers don't have a unique identifier for repositories and where
                  that's the case, no uniqueness is validated by the service. Note
                  that if OS Inventory is disabled, a VM will not be assigned a policy
                  that targets by OS because the service will see this VM's OS as
                  unknown.
