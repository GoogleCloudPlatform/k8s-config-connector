                  If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s),
                  the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.

                  The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".

                  retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s),
                  which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.

                  Valid values are:

                  - CONNECT_FAILURE: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for example due to connection timeouts.
                  - HTTP_5XX: Retry if the origin responds with any 5xx response code, or if the origin does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams.
                  - GATEWAY_ERROR: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
                  - RETRIABLE_4XX: Retry for retriable 4xx response codes, which include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
                  - NOT_FOUND: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not Found). This can be useful when generating video content, and the segment is not available yet.
                  - FORBIDDEN: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 403 (Forbidden). Possible values: ["CONNECT_FAILURE", "HTTP_5XX", "GATEWAY_ERROR", "RETRIABLE_4XX", "NOT_FOUND", "FORBIDDEN"].

                      Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.

                      If a failoverOrigin is specified, the maxAttemptsTimeout of the first configured origin sets the deadline for all connection attempts across all failoverOrigins.

                      Defaults to 30 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s.

                      The responseTimeout starts after the connection has been established.

                      This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to the client.

                      If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.

                  that was most recently observed by the Config Connector controller.
                  If this is equal to metadata.generation, then that means that the
                  current reported status reflects the most recent desired state of
                  the resource.
