                             fields. The last field entry is always for the field path `__name__`. If,

                             defined. If the final field in a composite index is not directional, the
                             `__name__` will be ordered ASCENDING (unless explicitly specified).

                             For single field indexes, this will always be exactly one entry with a
                             field path equal to the field path of the associated field.
