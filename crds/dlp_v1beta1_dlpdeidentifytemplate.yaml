                                        and the surrogate is ''abc'', the full replacement
                                        value will be: ''MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc''
                                        This annotation identifies the surrogate when

                                        the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
                                        Note: For record transformations where the
                                        entire cell in a table is being transformed,
                                        surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are
                                        used to denote the location of the token and
                                        are necessary for re-identification in free
                                        form text. In order for inspection to work
                                        properly, the name of this info type must
                                        not occur naturally anywhere in your data;
                                        otherwise, inspection may either - reverse

                                        surrogate and result in an error Therefore,
                                        choose your custom info type name carefully
                                        after considering what your data looks like.
                                        One way to select a name that has a high chance
                                        of yielding reliable detection is to include
                                        one or more unicode characters that are highly
                                        improbable to exist in your data. For example,

                                        in your data; otherwise, inspection may find
                                        a surrogate that does not correspond to an

                                        custom infoType name carefully after considering
                                        what your data looks like. One way to select

                                                  when inspecting content using the
                                                  custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype).
                                                  This facilitates reversal of the
                                                  surrogate when it occurs in free
                                                  text. In order for inspection to
                                                  work properly, the name of this
                                                  infoType must not occur naturally
                                                  anywhere in your data; otherwise,
                                                  inspection may find a surrogate
                                                  that does not correspond to an actual
                                                  identifier. Therefore, choose your
                                                  custom infoType name carefully after
                                                  considering what your data looks
                                                  like. One way to select a name that
                                                  has a high chance of yielding reliable
                                                  detection is to include one or more

                                                  improbable to exist in your data.
                                                  For example, assuming your data

                                        Note: For record transformations where the

                                        surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are
                                        used to denote the location of the token and

                                        properly, the name of this info type must
                                        not occur naturally anywhere in your data;

                                        One way to select a name that has a high chance

                                        For example, if the name of custom infoType

                                        identifies the surrogate when inspecting content
                                        using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype).

                                        inspection to work properly, the name of this
                                        infoType must not occur naturally anywhere
                                        in your data; otherwise, inspection may find
                                        a surrogate that does not correspond to an
                                        actual identifier. Therefore, choose your
                                        custom infoType name carefully after considering
                                        what your data looks like. One way to select
                                        a name that has a high chance of yielding
                                        reliable detection is to include one or more

                                        to exist in your data. For example, assuming

                                        this range (inclusive ends). Negative means
                                        shift to earlier in time. Must not be more
