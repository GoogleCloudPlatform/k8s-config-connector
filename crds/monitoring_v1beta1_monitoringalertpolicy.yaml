                                  The groupByFields determine how
                                  the time series are partitioned
                                  into subsets prior to applying the
                                  aggregation function. Each subset
                                  contains time series that have the
                                  same value for each of the
                                  grouping fields. Each individual
                                  time series is a member of exactly
                                  one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                                  is applied to each subset of time
                                  series. It is not possible to

                                  types, so this field implicitly
                                  contains resource.type. Fields not
                                  specified in groupByFields are
                                  aggregated away. If groupByFields

                                  aggregated into a single output
                                  time series. If crossSeriesReducer
