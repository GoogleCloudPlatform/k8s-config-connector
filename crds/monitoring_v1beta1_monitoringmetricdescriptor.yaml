                  It is only applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`,
                  or `DISTRIBUTION`. The `unit` defines the representation of the
                  stored metric values. Different systems might scale the values to
                  be more easily displayed (so a value of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed
                  as `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`).
                  However, if the `unit` is `kBy`, then the value of the metric is
                  always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.
                  If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds
                  used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose
                  `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the
                  job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`.
                  Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more
                  granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose
                  `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is
                  `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`).
                  The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units
                  of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard: **Basic
                  units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second * `min` minute
                  * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes (PREFIX)** *
                  `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12)
                  * `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z` zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta
                  (10^24) * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9)
                  * `p` pico (10^-12) * `f` femto (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z`
                  zepto (10^-21) * `y` yocto (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi
                  (2^20) * `Gi` gibi (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50)
                  **Grammar** The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division
                  or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or
                  `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never have `/s` in a metric
                  `unit`; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying
                  cumulative or delta value). * `.` multiplication or composition
                  (as an infix operator). For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The
                  grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component: { "."
                  Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT |
                  "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME
                  "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`.
                  If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to
                  `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`.
                  * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
                  containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless
                  unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1,
                  such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units
                  are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented
                  as `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5
                  new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would
                  be represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a
                  metric value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%`
                  represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving
                  a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of
                  0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates
                  a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will
                  be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric
                  value `0.03` means "3 percent").'
