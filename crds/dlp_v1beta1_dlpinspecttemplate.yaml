                                          is 1, then it is upgraded to `LIKELY`, while
                                          a value of -1 would downgrade it to `UNLIKELY`.
                                          Likelihood may never drop below `VERY_UNLIKELY`
                                          or exceed `VERY_LIKELY`, so applying an
                                          adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment
                                          of -1 when base likelihood is `VERY_LIKELY`
                                          will result in a final likelihood of `LIKELY`.
