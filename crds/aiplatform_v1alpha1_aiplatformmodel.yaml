                       `CMD`'s "default parameters" form.

                       If you don't specify this field but do specify the
                       [command][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ModelContainerSpec.command] field,
                       then the command from the `command` field runs without any additional
                       arguments. See the [Kubernetes documentation about how the `command` and
                       `args` fields interact with a container's `ENTRYPOINT` and

                       [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) and
                       `CMD` determine what runs based on their default behavior. See the Docker
                       documentation about [how `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`
                       interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact).

                       environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following
                       syntax: <code>$(<var>VARIABLE_NAME</var>)</code> Note that this differs
                       from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable
                       cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To
                       avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for
                       example: <code>$$(<var>VARIABLE_NAME</var>)</code> This field corresponds
                       to the `args` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core

                       Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a
                       Docker `ENTRYPOINT`'s "exec" form, not its "shell" form.

                       If you do not specify this field, then the container's `ENTRYPOINT` runs,
                       in conjunction with the
                       [args][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ModelContainerSpec.args] field or the
                       container's [`CMD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd),
                       if either exists. If this field is not specified and the container does not
                       have an `ENTRYPOINT`, then refer to the Docker documentation about [how
                       `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`
                       interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact).

                       If you specify this field, then you can also specify the `args` field to
                       provide additional arguments for this command. However, if you specify this
                       field, then the container's `CMD` is ignored. See the
                       [Kubernetes documentation about how the
                       `command` and `args` fields interact with a container's `ENTRYPOINT` and

                       environment variables.

                       Additionally, the
                       [command][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ModelContainerSpec.command] and
                       [args][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ModelContainerSpec.args] fields can
                       reference these variables. Later entries in this list can also reference
                       earlier entries. For example, the following example sets the variable
                       `VAR_2` to have the value `foo bar`:

                       ```json
                       [
                         {

                         }
                       ]
                       ```

                       If you switch the order of the variables in the example, then the expansion
                       does not occur.

                          Required. Map from feature names to feature input metadata. Keys are the

                          An empty InputMetadata is valid. It describes a text feature which has the

                       The JSON Lines format, where each instance is a single line. Uses

                       * `csv`
                       The CSV format, where each instance is a single comma-separated line.
                       The first line in the file is the header, containing comma-separated field
                       names. Uses
                       [GcsSource][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.BatchPredictionJob.InputConfig.gcs_source].

                       * `tf-record`
                       The TFRecord format, where each instance is a single record in tfrecord

                       * `bigquery`
                       Each instance is a single row in BigQuery. Uses
                       [BigQuerySource][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.BatchPredictionJob.InputConfig.bigquery_source].

                       * `file-list`
                       Each line of the file is the location of an instance to process, uses

                       If this Model doesn't support any of these formats it means it cannot be

                       exist, the predictions are returned together with their instances. In other
                       words, the prediction has the original instance data first, followed by the
                       actual prediction content (as per the schema).

                       The possible formats are:

                       * `jsonl`
                       The JSON Lines format, where each prediction is a single line. Uses
                       [GcsDestination][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.BatchPredictionJob.OutputConfig.gcs_destination].

                       * `csv`
                       The CSV format, where each prediction is a single comma-separated line.
                       The first line in the file is the header, containing comma-separated field
                       names. Uses
                       [GcsDestination][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.BatchPredictionJob.OutputConfig.gcs_destination].

                       * `bigquery`
                       Each prediction is a single row in a BigQuery table, uses
                       [BigQueryDestination][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.BatchPredictionJob.OutputConfig.bigquery_destination]
                       .

                       If this Model doesn't support any of these formats it means it cannot be
