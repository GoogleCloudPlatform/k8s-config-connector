                  A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
                  They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                  They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                  Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

                                  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                  You may set this, for example:
                                  * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.
                                  * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.

                                  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
                                  You may set this, for example:
                                  * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.
                                  * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be handled by a human.

                      To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine learning classification threshold.
                      If the returned score value is less than the threshold value, then a no-match event will be triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the default of 0.3 is used.
