                      Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
                      events of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The
                      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
                      logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
                      has higher precedence than AND.

                      Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
                      a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
                      map to those defined in the corresponding resource.

                      The supported operators are:

                      * = for all value types.
                      * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
                      * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.

                      The supported value types are:

                      * string literals in quotes.
                      * integer literals without quotes.
                      * boolean literals true and false without quotes.
