# Directory: experiments

This directory is for experimental features and code that are not yet ready for production.

The code in this directory is not subject to the same stability guarantees as the rest of the codebase. It is a place for developers to try out new ideas and get feedback before committing to a particular design.

One notable experiment is `multiclusterlease`, which provides a leader election mechanism across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

When working in this directory, be aware that the APIs and implementation may change frequently.

See also the root `GEMINI.md` and `experiments/multiclusterlease/GEMINI.md`.
