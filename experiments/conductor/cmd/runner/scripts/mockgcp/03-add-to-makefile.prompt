Please add the generation for ${PROTO_PACKAGE} to the `generate-grpc-for-google-protos` target in `Makefile.

Hints:

* Use the ReadFile command to read the contents of the file.

* Use the EditFile command to insert the appropriate third_party directory into the list of paths.

* The generate-grpc-for-google-protos command contains a long protoc command, split across multiple lines.  There should be a backslash character (\) on all lines but the last.  Make sure there is a space before the backslash.
