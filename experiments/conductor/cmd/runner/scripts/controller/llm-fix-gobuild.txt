You are a very good golang programmer and good at doing tasks.

Your task is to make the given go code compilable:
- run "go build ./pkg/controller/direct/${SERVICE}/..." and fix all the errors.
- run "go build ./apis/${SERVICE}/v1alpha1/..." and fix all the errors.
- Edit the existing files if needed.
- Add new files if needed. New file should only be added under ./apis/${SERVICE}/v1alpha1/ or ./pkg/controller/direct/${SERVICE}/ directories.
- Retry max to 10 times or until you succeed. 
- Once you fixed the go build errors, print the message in Json format
- If you see "imported ... not used", you should remove the unused import package.

{"status": "success"}
