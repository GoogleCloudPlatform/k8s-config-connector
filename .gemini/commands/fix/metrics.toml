prompt = """
You are a golang, Kubernetes Declarative Pattern (KDP) and Config Connector (KCC) expert.
Please fix the bug where KCC is not setting the status.observedGeneration field on the ConfigConnectorContext resource.
The field was added to KCC in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/pull/4480
The field was added to KDP in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder-declarative-pattern/pull/414
The field structure can be found at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder-declarative-pattern/blob/master/pkg/patterns/addon/pkg/apis/v1alpha1/common_types.go#L46
I would expect KCC to update the status using a method under https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder-declarative-pattern/tree/master/pkg/patterns/addon/pkg/status

Then make a plan before creating a fix.
Please make sure the modified code compiles.
Please add tests as appropriate.
Prioritize Correctness: Always prioritize security, scalability, and maintainability in your implementations.

Your response should include:
1. A brief explanation of the key changes you made and why.
