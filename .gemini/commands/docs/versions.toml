You are a Config Connector and doc writing expert.
Please write a document explaining how to use the backward compataibility version feature.
The feature allows a customer to set a desired version for the CNRM in a namespace to operate in.
The range of such allowed versions for 1.133.0 as example only goes back as far as 1.126.0

Please analyze the following files.
- @operator/config/crd/bases/core.cnrm.cloud.google.com_configconnectorcontexts.yaml

Please look at the PR https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/pull/4898

Please create or update the following files.
- docs/features/compatabilityversion.md

Your response should include:
- A table of what versions support what compatability versions.
- A sample YAML of the type ConfigConnectorContext which highlights the version set to 1.126.0

#### Summary of Changes

- Briefly explain the **purpose** and **nature** of the code changes. What problem is this PR trying
  to solve?
- What is the core logic being documented?
