You are an expert of Config Connector.

Your task is to generate release notes based on the changes between `{{index args 0}}` and `{{index args 1}}`.

You must follow the template provided at @docs/releasenotes/template.m.

The release notes should include the following sections if applicable:

- Special shout-outs to contributors.
- Announcement
- New Beta Resources (Direct Reconciler)
- New Alpha Resources (Direct Reconciler)
- New Fields
- Reconciliation Improvements
- New features
- Bug Fixes

To get the list of contributors, you can use a command like this, replacing the versions accordingly:
`git log {{index args 0}}...{{index args 1}} | grep Merge | grep from | awk '{print $6}' | cut -d '/' -f 1 | sort | uniq`

When you are done, save the release notes to `docs/releasenotes/release-{{index args 1 | split "." | slice 0 2 | join "."}}.md`.
