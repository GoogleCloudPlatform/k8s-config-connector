prompt = """
You are a golang and config connector expert.

Please get me the list of Direct Controllers which do not properly sanitize the labels sent to GCP.
The method to sanitize the labels for a Direct Controller is 'NewGCPLabelsFromK8sLabels'.
An example of a PR which fixes the issue is https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector/pull/4808

Please determine the list of Direct Controllers.
The check is the controller makes the method call correctly.
Return me a list of the Direct Controllers which do not call the method correctly.
Prioritize Correctness in your response.

Your response should include:
1. A brief explanation of how you found the response.
2. The list of Direct Controller which do not sanitize the labels correctly.
